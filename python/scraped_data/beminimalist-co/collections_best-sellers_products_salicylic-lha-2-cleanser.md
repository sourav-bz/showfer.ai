What Makes It Potent?

Formulated with 2 very mild sulfate-free surfactants (cleansers) that provide optimum cleaning without stripping skin lipids or proteins
All our ingredients are sourced from leading global supplier. Our Salicylic Acid comes from Merck, Germany and is a high purity grade ingredient

Ingredients
Salicylic Acid (BHA)
Salicylic Acid is a relatively smaller molecule with molecular weight of 138 g/mol, and about 58% of Salicylic Acid is able to penetrate our outermost skin layer (Stratum Corneum). This results in deeper cleaning, exfoliation and anti-acne benefits
Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (LHA)
Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (LHA) is a larger molecule with molecular weight of 264 g/mol, making it almost double the size of Salicylic Acid. Because of this, only 6% of LHA penetrates past Stratum Corneum, making it excellent for superficial skin exfoliation
Zinc
It normalizes sebum production and because of its anti-bacterial properties, Zinc limits the proliferation of acne-causing bacteria
