FAQs
What does vitamin C serum do for the skin?
Vitamin C serum is a powerful antioxidant that has the power to neutralise free radicals, which in turn protects skin and prevents photo-ageing. The exposure to UV leads to skin ageing and sagging of the skin. Regular usage of Vitamin C can brighten the skin tone while reducing the signs of ageing.
Can I use Vitamin C in AM?
Yes! Vitamin C is an antioxidant and it neutralizes radicals. Ultraviolet light emitted by the sun induces free radical formation in the skin and that leads to photo aging and even cancer. Vitamin C is a great antioxidant and it protects the skin against the harmful effects of UV radiation. So itâ€™s not only safe to use Vitamin C during the day, it in fact is helpful to do that. However, please note that Vitamin C is not a replacement for your sunscreen and you should always layer your Vitamin C serum with a good sunscreen when using Vitamin C during the day.
Does this need to be refrigerated?
We have used a stabilized Vitamin C derivative and formulated it carefully at the right pH. Also, the product comes in a UV protective bottle, so the product would remain stable when stored in a cool, dry area, away from direct sunlight. Keeping the bottle in a refrigerator is not needed.
