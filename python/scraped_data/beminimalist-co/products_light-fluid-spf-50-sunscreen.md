Great indoor Sunscreen
It is lightweight and very comfortable on skin.I will repurchase it as an indoor sunscreen because it is not at all water and sweat resistant.

No. It does not leave any white cast or unwanted residue behind, after application.
Is it safe for all skin types?
Yes. This is a light-weight sunscreen suitable for all skin types.
