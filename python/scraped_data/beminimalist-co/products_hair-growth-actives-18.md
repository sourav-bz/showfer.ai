Vitalizes outer root sheath stem cells, hence triggering a new hair cycle. It also nourishes hair follices, which accelerates Anagen phase (hair growth phase)
Procapil (3%)
Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1, promotes hair anchoring by strengthening the follicle metabolism and structure
Anagain (3%) + Baicapil (4%)
Reduce hair loss by inducing dermal papilla cells, activating telogen follicles and extending the anagen phase
