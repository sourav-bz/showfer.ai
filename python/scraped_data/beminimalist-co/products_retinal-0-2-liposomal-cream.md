What Makes It Potent?
Retinal is new-age molecule & is form of vitamin A that acts up to 11 times faster than classic retinol. At 0.2% concentration this formula offers an optimum dosage of this powerful molecule. Helps boost collagen & improve cell turnover to fight multiple signs of aging like fine lines, wrinkles & loss of elasticity.
Liposomal Delivery System (a form of encapsulation technology) helps delivering actives deeper into the skin, maximising the efficacy of this formula & minimizing irritation. This encapsulation process helps protects Retinal from degradation thus maintaining its stability and performance.
2 powerful antioxidants in form of Resveratrol and EUK-134 work in conjunction with Retinal. Resveratrol slows down photoaging by reducing the expression of AP-1 and NF-kB factors. EUK-134 biomimics natural enzymes & protects skin against UV-induced DNA damage.
The cream's lightweight, non-greasy texture is enriched with hydrators and skin-soothing ingredients (like Tasmannia Fruit Extract), leaving the skin feeling calm, soft, and nourished.
Ideal For
Skin type:
Dry/Normal, Sensitive, Oily/Combination
Concerns:
Fine Lines, Wrinkles & Uneven Texture
Suitable for:
18+ years of age
How to Use
Apply a pea-sized amount to clean, dry face and neck in the evening. Avoid contact with eyes.
When to use:
PM. Start with every alternate day  to allow your skin time to adjust to this potent molecule. After 2 weeks of usage, you can use it everyday depending on how your skin responds. If you are new to Retinol/Retinal, we recommend to start with 0.3% formula first and then upgrade to this product after 2 months. This will allow your skin time to build tolerance to Retinol/Retinal.

Ingredients
Retinal
A powerful form of Vitamin A, it is known for its superior efficacy in reducing fine lines, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone. It helps boost collagen & improve cell turnover, to reveal a more youthful, radiant complexion.
Resveratrol
A potent antioxidant, Resveratrol helps protect the skin from environmental stressors and free radicals. It slows down photoaging and works synergistically with Retinal in this formula.
EUK-134
A highly stable, self-regenerating molecule that mimics the natural antioxidant enzymes Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase. EUK-134 provides robust protection against oxidative stress, reducing signs of aging and enhancing skin’s resilience.

FAQs
Why is Minimalist Retinal 0.2% orange in color?
EUK-134 & Tasmannia Fruit Extract has dark brown characteristic color and along with Lecithin used for creating the liposomal system, they impart brown color to the otherwise yellow color of Retinal.
When should I start using Retinal?
Ideally, begin using Retinal in your late 20s to prevent early signs of aging. If you already have fine lines or wrinkles, it can still be beneficial for corrective care.
What is Liposomal Technology, and why is it important?
Liposomal Technology is an advanced encapsulation system that protects unstable Retinal from degradation. It encapsulates Retinal in lipid spheres, allowing for deeper penetration into the skin. This results in a more effective formula with optimal anti-aging benefits.
Which products can and cannot be paired with Retinal?
Avoid using direct acids like AHA or BHA with Retinal. If using acids, use in alternate routine. Always wear sunscreen the next day if using Retinal.
Retinal pairs well with ingredients like Peptides, Vitamin C, Niacinamide, Hyaluronic Acid, and others.
