Story
It seemed like an odd choice of location to meet someone for the very first time “ wasnt a library somewhere you went, when you wanted to be left alone? But shed already agreed and it was too late to cancel.
She begrudgingly picked out a flouncy white dress, ran a scarf through her unruly hair and smeared a little rouge on her cheeks. If words were meant to be scarce at this date, then her appearance would have to do the talking.
The smell of old books was intoxicating. She picked up several, starting to read in the middle and losing herself in the printed words. When her eyes grew tired, she let her lids hang heavy and felt the raised texture of the print with her fingertips. When it was time to go home, she knew the date had been perfect “ shed fallen in love with herself again.
Rekindle your love affair with yourself, in this off-white handloom cotton dress featuring beautiful hand-embroidered details.

SUTADR040A
Description
Handloom cotton is handwoven by our weavers by hand on mechanical looms. The process is time and labour-intensive, using techniques that have been passed down across generations of artisans. The resultant fabric is extraordinarily soft, breathable and resilient, and also drapes very well. Using handloom cotton not only helps us to work with smaller weavers but also plays an important role in reducing the environmental footprint of the garments we produce. These dresses also feature delicate hand-embroidered details to make each piece truly memorable.

The process is time and labour-intensive, using techniques that have been passed down across generations of artisans. The resultant fabric is extraordinarily soft, breathable and resilient, and also drapes very well. Using handloom cotton not only helps us to work with smaller weavers but also plays an important role in reducing the environmental footprint of the garments we produce. These dresses also feature delicate hand-embroidered details to make each piece truly memorable.\u003c\/p\u003e"}
