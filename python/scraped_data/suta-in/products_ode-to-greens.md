Story
They say electricity is a boon to mankind. Gadgets, wifi, video calls, television the list surely is long. Every member of the family is now happy, with extra luminance on their faces thanks to their mobiles glowing bright. But, they didn't realise what true joy was until a power-cut bought them together one fine evening. And, somewhere around them, irony patted its own back for a job well done!
This saree is an ode to the greens around us; to the nature. Stop and smell the flowers, take in the magnificence and surround yourself with real beauty. And, don't forget to let our Made in Heaven mul cotton saree drape you into a bundle of prettiness
Description
The mul cotton is what we call ˜made in heaven at Suta. Known in West Bengal as mul mul, the fabric is buttery soft and delicately beautiful. The weave of this fabric is very fine, and this lends a very fluid texture to it that makes draping it a breeze. It is truly like a hug that wraps you in its love!
