Story 
The air, the ground, time, the water, everything seemed to stand still as she heard those magical words. She thought that her jaw just dropped down to the ground but in reality she did not move at all. She had gotten that deal and her dream journey had started right there in that moment. As she looked at her reflection in the lake, she saw a crystal clear image. She saw an entrepreneur!
This blue cotton saree with a touch of mul and viscose slub is prettiness redefined!
Description
Viscose is a natural fabric that is made using the viscose fibre. This fibre is extracted using a special process that involves dissolving wood pulp and regenerating it in the form of fibres. Viscose is a manufactured fibre that is made using natural materials and the final product is very similar to naturally occurring fibres such as cotton in terms of look and feel. 
For Suta products, viscose fibre as weft is woven with cotton fibre as warp to create a fabric that is a magical blend of the comfort of cotton and the subtle shine of viscose. This fabric feels beautifully soft to the skin.

Natasha S.
What a beautiful colour. I paired it with a Suta blouse and tied it in an infinity drape and went out and at least 3 people stopped and told me that saree and style was beautiful! It was so confortable to move in….simply loved how it felt! Thank you!
Vidya P.
Such an elegant saree, loved it .. Thank you Suta!
Vineetha D.
Disappointed. I ordered the saree as my sister had bought the same piece a few months back. However when I received the piece, it was of a different texture. Requested them for return, the said NO. Said it was a piece on some discount. How was I to know! Waste of precious money. On top of it, they irritate you seeking feedback! Suta, never again.
HEMANT N.
Beautiful saree, so soft and easy to handle.
I ordered it from singapore, I was bit worried about piko fall for saree but it was all done and ready to wear. I am so happy with Suta brand.. and I got it in 5 days by DTDC from India.

Just one suggestion, With every saree please suggest a blouse as well..it would be of great help..
Thankyou so much ...would love to buy again.

I have till date 5 Suta mul sarees. That itself says how I feel wearing your sarees. I love the texture, the fall, the fragrance and the colours. I am a senior citizen and no longer comfortable wearing heavy sarees. Suta has come as a blessing to me. Your sarees are so light that after draping, I feel as if i am floating.... Thank you Suta....for making me feel young, fresh and light!!! Love you...
