Story
She never knew that she had this intense side to her. She had been a delicate darling, never exposed to the harsh realities of life. Her loved ones protected her like a precious jewel, unaware of the deep reservoirs of strength within her. But, when testing times visited in full force, she held her chin up and became a whole new person. It wasnt much later after conquering her dark times did she realise that she had grown up all of a sudden. The delicate darling now realised that she was a kaleidoscope of colours, each more beautiful than the other!
This uniquely beautiful grey, mustard and maroon made in heaven mul saree is truly a sight to behold!
Description
The mul cotton is what we call ˜made in heaven at Suta. Known in West Bengal as mul mul, the fabric is buttery soft and delicately beautiful. The weave of this fabric is very fine, and this lends a very fluid texture to it that makes draping it a breeze. It is truly like a hug that wraps you in its love!

I can’t tell my experience in words, Suta makes me feel special everytime. I’ve ordered so many sarees from Suta, and the quality of fabric, packaging, comfort and the way it wrapped around the body amazed me. Always the first choice for sarees. Strongly recommend it.

Too soft to handle it
❤️❤️❤️
Aditi B.
Very soft to wear. But then very delicate these mul sarees are, very problematic to handle. I have bunch of suta sarees and they’re very delicate, that’s one thing that I don’t like
Anonymous
First saree from suta after eyeing this one especially for very long. Soft fabric but also too delicate to handle. Little big on the thinner side so costly for its price.
Prathyusha  G.

THIRVENI M.
We did not like the saree. We applied for return on Dec 27th. Its been 12th Jan and still no one comes to get it. When ever called, they say tomorrow we will send person to collect it. 2570inr is not a less amount. Suta is not doing a trustworthy business as far Iordered.
Ashita
The saree looks absolutely stunning! Very happy with the quality and also the quick turn around with the delivery.
Sarah J.

Silky A.
Don't buy this too delicate fabric. I was just trying it on, and it got torn, by just touching my center table. Can you imagine!
Riti K.
Beautiful and elegant. Just as shown in picture. Very pretty colour combination.
Jainisha D.
Best collection from SUTA for daily use at work or offices for all the women during all the seasons.
Amrita S.
Personally, I believe this is one of the most gorgeous sarees in the Suta Collection. The colour combinations and the softness of the feel.....So easy to drape. I walked for hours Pandal hopping in this....felt like I was wearing air.

One of most beautiful and comfortable saree I have in my collection
Sunitha G.
Beautiful saree
Shabeena S.
Saree is beautiful..but the problem is i got a saree that was definitely a used one. It was not brand new. Someone has worn it and I've got it after a proper clean. It already has the fall stitched too..
Mausumi  K.
I am a boss.The admixture of colours made me feel in command and the softness of the drape made me feel comfortable.
apurva D.
Sari was amazing- the material, the feel, the look, everything. And the fact that Suta gives you ready-made saris is so so awesome!! Suta sari made my Durga Pujo so much better!!
Ashmini S.
The Saree was very thin and totally transparent. I don't think it was a good deal at this price.

Obsessed and amazed at this sari! Light, and airy, gorgeous rich tones and one of a kind. The mul material is lovely. The sari comes with a fall on, and completely finished. Choice of blouses are many, i paired it with their plain safed white blouse and it’s summery.
Love the Suta brand, glad I came upon it while surfing the internet.
