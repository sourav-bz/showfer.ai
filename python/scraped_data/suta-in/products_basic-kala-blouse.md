Story
How much of tears and monstrous laughter the black of the night has seen. So much of who I am comes to the fore with uninhibited passion as the curtains of darkness fall. Under the mystical gaze of the moon, there is something that comforts me and lets me be. What is this connection between me and the night? I wonder. No answers in sight, I just blow a kiss to the unending black and it softly kisses me back!
This black blouse in cotton silk is just what you need!

SUTAB347A

Silk is alluring and can boast of a grand appeal as well as a tinge of nostalgia. On the whole, silk is a fabric that can never go wrong. This artificial silk fabric is made with synthetic fibres that look and feel like silk while making the luxurious experience of silk affordable to all.

Shruti H.
As always perfect fitting and outstanding quality
Swesha S.
Love the blouse. However, horrible exchange and return protocol. I'd much rather pay an extra 50 bucks to exchange for a smaller size than get credit for it and then purchase the next size. May not purchase again due to this policy
Lavanya C.
Love the quality!
Purnima S.

I never knew a strappy padded blouse could fit my busty 
figure so well!!! Worth the investment
Rupak D.
Same material, same design, absolutely same blouse from Soch company in 998 rs only.
Shobha C.
Mast
Swati R.
Absolutely loved the pain black sleeveless blouse. It fit almost perfectly. Needed just half an inch to be reduced on the armhole, and after that it was just perfect. I look forward to wearing it will so many more sarees. Thanks Suta.
Lekshmi S.
Excellent quality
Deepa  S.
Saree is super soft  it gives u simple yet classy look  forever Grateful Suta
Ekta B.
Worst fitting with the neck area bulging out revealing the entirety of the front area. Cups are not at the right places to support the breasts. Looks like sewn in haste. Will not be recommending it to anyone! Dug a big hole in my pocket! It would have been economical to buy a fabric and get it stitched by a tailor as these people are charging approximately 2k for something that has no fitting or any attention to the stitching or a decent fabric! 
Don’t buy!
Priyanka Saha S.
The stitching is so fine and the fitting is excellent. ♥️
Patel j.
blouse was long n looks like the fit is for tall girls like above 5,5”
Sofina M.
Thank you Suta for the perfect fit blouse
Vidya  P.
I recently purchased this gorgeous saree, and I'm thrilled with my choice! The intricate design and vibrant colors from suta immediately caught my eye. Best in my wardrobe!
Asmita C.
I would like to return the blouse the material is synthetic mixed and the fit is bad. Thanks

Terrible experience
Pritisha G.
Very good
Ankhi D.
Suta has changed the design of this blouse. I had to return it
Anu G.
It's just amazing
Bidisha G.
Liked it
Kashmira t.
Size is a bit big. Not as mentioned in dimensions. And the size varies for the same style, same size, different colours. So the sizing is not consistent.
Joanne C.
Nice to have so many options of blouses available to suit difficult styles of saris
Vaishnavi P.
The blouse is amazing but it didn't go well with me... Maybe I should reduce a little
Kasturi G.
Great fit, great quality. Easily one of the most important staples in my ethnic wardrobe.
Candice C.
Blouse fit is perfect although there have been times when Suta blouses didnt fit as well.  The fabric gives a rich and elegant look.
Gunmeet K.
I raised a request for change in size .. the product was picked but it’s been a week and I have had no response from the team , I was promised my size , but there is no information.. it’s absolutely disappointing
Sowmya M.
Excellent fit!!
S L.
Beautiful
Poullomi P.
First time purchase. Excellent quality of fabric, stitching, style, and comfort.
Aditi S.
I am very disappointed with these set of blouses. 
1. The cup size has been reduced
2. The cup is placed too high and does not fit well.
3. The arm hole is also too small.
Ipsita M.
Excellent fit
Sruthi E.
The quality of the fabric was good but fit was little tighter than the usual SuTa fit for the same size.
Pooja S.
A big fan of SUTA... Love your collection!!!
Sumi M.
i received an old blouse with lint all over it, black colour faded and almost grey in colour
Vidya  L.
I got this saree for my birthday!!  From creating to delivery, suta packed their love and it feels.  This saree fetched me lot of compliments.  The blouse fits like glove.
Customer
For the money I gave, I expected a much better quality product. 
Expensive and flimsy.
Awantika A.
Very loose and size is 2 times bigger than my recommended size
Sreyosi D.
Perfect fit!
Preeti k.
I am a frequent buyer of Suta blouse and Sarees and I must say they look completely different in crowd even if its a low budget saree or blouse.
Thank you Suta and definitely I will be shopping more to enhance my Wardrobe ❤️

The blouse fitting is perfect and the quality is great. Need to order more from Suta :)
Nimeran S.
I found the top not ver yellow fitting for someone with above average bust line. Had to get extra hooks put in to make it fit. Quality of fabric and construction was very good.
Uma G.
Perfect fit (S)...love it! & Many thanks to Suta!
Jenny J.
I needed a black blouse urgently for a Diwali party was two days away. What were the chances, slim I thought. But I got it, the blouse arrived within two days of ordering And it wasn't basic as the name suggests, it was fantastic. I'm not getting another blouse stitched again, this fit me like a glove.

Perfect blouse. I have been loving the basic blouse collection. I have already ordered 6 colors so far.They are spot on with their measurements. Highly recommend these blouses.
Nina R.
Loved the fit , quality and versatility of this blouse.
Geetika S.
The material and the fitting is perfect… Must say the Suta team is working beyond perfection and addressed every query and issues in a well manner and service was smooth.
Nidhi S.
I bought the basic black blouse after finding earlier fits of other basic colours perfect for me. But this black blouse is quite loose and haphazardly stitched. For an important event i first wore it to, i had to pin it under with multiple pins and still the neckline kept bumping up. Consistency in the stitching of same products would be great.
Poonam  S.
