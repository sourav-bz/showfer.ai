Story
Just like a dream, she never knew when her love for herself started. Maybe it started even before her memory became a part of her. Maybe, she put on her crown even before she came into the world, only to arrive in perfect style for this wonderful journey!
This sultry made in heaven mul saree in blue is a sight to behold!
Description
No matter how much we move forward in time, it is often our very roots that hold us in place. As far as our fabrics are concerned, we are in an age of constant innovation and up-gradation. Even so, our love for age-old crafts and processes like block printing can never fade. Block printing is an art that is at least a few centuries old. Especially in India, the art has evolved to incorporate the motifs and designs of different regions. It is a process of printing designs on a base fabric using wooden stamps dipped in dye. The charm lies in the fact that all the steps of block printing are done by artisans using their hands. Right from carving the wooden stamp, which itself requires a lot of expertise and skill, to printing the fabric and drying it, each step is carried out by dedicated artisans. The intricately carved stamps are a wonder by themselves and there are separate sects of artisans who specialise in this and create highly nuanced wooden stamps using chisels, drills and hammers. Once this is done, mustard oil is applied to the stamps and they are left to soak up the oil to prevent cracks. Meanwhile, the base fabric is washed and dyed. Handloom fabrics are most preferred as they absorb the colours of the print gorgeously. Following this, the fabric is laid out on a flat surface and held in place with small pins. The wooden stamp is dipped in the chosen dye and then slammed onto the fabric in one forceful motion. The entire saree or as much as required is printed this way by consecutively pressing the stamp on the fabric with force. After the process is over, the saree is washed and dried. The patience, skill and creativity of artisans come forth brilliantly with a hand block printed saree. There are bound to be small irregularities in the print as a result of human error and that lends a whole new level of allure to this art-form.
The block-printing on this saree is done on a made-in-heaven mul cotton fabric which is lighter than air and loved by our Suta Queens immensely.
The mul cotton is what we call ˜made in heaven at Suta. Known in West Bengal as mul mul, the fabric is buttery soft and delicately beautiful. The weave of this fabric is very fine, and this lends a very fluid texture to it that makes draping it a breeze. It is truly like a hug that wraps you in its love!

Thank u suta
Ayesha N.
A beautiful, minimal saari. The colour is a pale-ish blue and very calming to look at. I appreciate the speed at which it reached me, especially during a pandemic, but getting it shipped and customs etc was quite expensive.

As far as our fabrics are concerned, we are in an age of constant innovation and up-gradation. Even so, our love for age-old crafts and processes like block printing can never fade. Block printing is an art that is at least a few centuries old. Especially in India, the art has evolved to incorporate the motifs and designs of different regions. It is a process of printing designs on a base fabric using wooden stamps dipped in dye. The charm lies in the fact that all the steps of block printing are done by artisans using their hands. Right from carving the wooden stamp, which itself requires a lot of expertise and skill, to printing the fabric and drying it, each step is carried out by dedicated artisans. The intricately carved stamps are a wonder by themselves and there are separate sects of artisans who specialise in this and create highly nuanced wooden stamps using chisels, drills and hammers. Once this is done, mustard oil is applied to the stamps and they are left to soak up the oil to prevent cracks. Meanwhile, the base fabric is washed and dyed. Handloom fabrics are most preferred as they absorb the colours of the print gorgeously. Following this, the fabric is laid out on a flat surface and held in place with small pins. The wooden stamp is dipped in the chosen dye and then slammed onto the \u003c\/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003efabric in one forceful motion. The entire saree or as much as required is printed this way by consecutively pressing the stamp on the fabric with force. After the process is over, the saree is washed and dried. The patience, skill and creativity of artisans come forth brilliantly with a hand block printed saree. There are bound to be small irregularities in the print as a result of human error and that lends a whole new level of allure to this art-form.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe block-printing on this saree is done on a made-in-heaven mul cotton fabric which is lighter than air and loved by our Suta Queens immensely.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mul cotton is what we call ˜made in heaven at Suta.
