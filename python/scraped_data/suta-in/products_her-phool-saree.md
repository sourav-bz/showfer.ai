 Story  
She had a way with words. Whatever the situation, she knew when to speak to turn things in her favour. Her quietness took after natures miracles. More than knowledge, it was patience. She waited for her turn and spoke wisely. A flower of Mother Earth, she lightly treaded in her shadow. And while the skies conspired with the tree-tops to transition into new seasons, her spirit evolved.
She is evergreen. She wears the full-blown beauty of autumn.
Look resplendent in our green and magenta saree made of cotton and acrylic. The saree features zari detailing and elegant rose motifs, making it the perfect choice for festive gatherings.
 
Description
One of the most popular natural fibres in the world, cotton is hailed for its beauty, comfort, durability and versatility. Cotton is naturally sustainable and its cultivation supports local farmers and communities. A low maintenance fabric, cotton is also hypoallergenic, making it the perfect choice around the year, especially for the Indian climate. We took this simple, elegant fabric and combined it with acrylic to add sheen, lustre and pizzazz. The inclusion of rose-themed zari motifs lends finesse to the saree, making it the star of every show!

Cotton is naturally sustainable and its cultivation supports local farmers and communities. A low maintenance fabric, cotton is also hypoallergenic, making it the perfect choice around the year, especially for the Indian climate. We took this simple, elegant fabric and combined it with acrylic to add sheen, lustre and pizzazz. The inclusion of rose-themed zari motifs lends finesse to the saree, making it the star of every show!  \u003cbr data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e \u003cbr data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cstyle type=\"text\/css\"\u003e\u003c!--\ntd {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}\n--\u003e\u003c\/style\u003e"}
