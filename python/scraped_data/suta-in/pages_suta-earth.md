Suta Earth
We are excited to introduce to you an initiative that is extremely close to our hearts – Suta Earth!
What is Suta Earth?
Suta Earth is a way for you to save upto 50% of your Suta purchases while also contributing towards a greener planet! How? We are collecting old sarees that you aren’t using anymore(any saree, not just Suta) and putting a system in place to upcycle them as packaging bags! As per the type of fabric that is sent, we will send you a discount code that you can use on your next purchase!
By doing this we are-
• Redirecting large volumes of fabric waste from ending up in landfills
• Conserving the fresh resources that would’ve been used to create packaging bags from fresh fabric
• Fostering of Suta Queens who join hands to tread lightly on this beautiful planet
It’s a WIN-WIN-WIN!
How can you be a part of this?
Step 1
Collect sarees that are no longer used by you. Check if the length is 5.5 metres or more. Pack the sarees and send them to the below address:
SUTA
(SUTA EARTH)
Ground Floor, Om Shivambika CHS Ltd, Sunder Nagar, Kalina,
SANTACRUZ EAST, Mumbai Suburban, Maharashtra, 400098
Contact number:
82915 79185
Step 2
After receiving your sarees, we will check to determine what fabric the saree is made of and send you a discount coupon code on email as per the type of fabric. We will call you back as soon as we receive your parcel to process your coupon.
Coupon amount you will receive as per the fabric
Synthetic Fabric - Rs 150
Cotton, Linen, Cellulose-Based Fabric - Rs 250
Silk Fabric -  Rs 400
Step 3
We will upcycle your sarees to make some goodies or packaging bags that will carry Suta love to Suta Queens all over the world!
To redeem the coupon code, your order value should be atleast double the discount code offered. Eg: If you get a coupon code of Rs 150 you can redeem it on a minimum purchase of Rs 300 (Yess! It means upto 50% off).
Single discount code will be given on the total number of sarees you send us, which you can use to buy any number of products.
Happy you, happy us, happy planet!
Yours consciously,
Suta
