Story
Their project for the day was to get mom out of her comfort zone and transform the way she looked for the last 20 years. Their stubbornness competed with their moms and finally met at that lacy blouse paired with that favourite saree of moms!
This off-white delicate lace blouse in the softest cotton is a must-have!

Customer Reviews
Vaishali B.
Liked the lacy material, fitting is good. Make in more colours.
Just one suggession to put big size pad.(not thick but the width should be little big to cover it properly)
One more suggession to make nice colourful crop tops with mirror and work on the background of Navratri.
Tina l.
The fit is awesome
Nusrat F J.
The elaborate neckline looked promising, but in the absence of buckram/stiffer material, it just keeps curling up and poking out instead of laying flat on the skin. Is that a neglect while stitching, because I think the design definitely needed buckram.
The material is nylon lacy, and the colour is pale yellow . As a loyal Suta customer, I would call this purchase a bad choice on my end.
Mithu s.
Good product
A K.

As usual buying from Suta means an amazing interface with the product. This time Lacy Macy blouses (bought two) are of high supreme quality and fashionable indeed.  Love to wear blouses from suta. My best wishes to Suta team in future endeavor. Love you.
Sandhya K.
Suta team , has won my heart. Although the lacy blouse didn't fit me , i loved the overall finish, cut n design . Suta team was pro in processing the refund, picking the product and closing it end to end. This is what i call it as delighting a customer ! Way to go Suta, i loved the way your earlier saree came to me, packed well with soothing fragrance.
Thank you for spreading love, i look forward to more corporate blouses in the coming day's in your collection...Cheers!
Sudha W.
The blouse colour was standing up and was not looking nice. Maybe should straighten after a wash !

It's very pretty specially the back but sadly i have to return it because of the front...thre front is too low ...very uncomfortable

Graceful lacy macy blouse. As L size was out of stock i purchased the XL size and got it refitted by my tailor! And it fits me just right ❤️ Matched it with snow cherries polka saree from the same brand :) keep up the great work
Mandeep S.
lovely
Reena J.
Beautiful blouse. Didn't get the exact fit as it was out of stock. Nevertheless with a few alterations, it's a snug fit. Loved the feel and comfort it offers. The colour is not white as it looks in the pic. This was off- white. But the fit and style quotient is commendable. Thanks Suta .

I got the Lacy Macy for my mom and she absolutely loves it... They customised it to what my mom wanted and it fits beautifully... Thanks guys you made her happy ❤️
Shrigayathri S.
Amazing blouse. Loved it ❤️❤️❤️
Suman V.
My 4th blouse from Sita. Ordered size S as usual first but it was big for me. Got it exchanged for XS and that fits perfectly. There’s only a thin net lining at back but it doesn’t matter much when wearing (for those who are worried about it). Overall I’m happy with it.
Dr raka H.
This is my second blouse purchased from Suta.. Just love it.. Perfect fitting.. Can't stop myself to buy more and more
Kanhaiya  Y.
My second purchase... m thoroughly satisfied... Loads of love... Suta..
Mitali G.
Thank you so much on behalf of my daughter. She loves it. Thanks also for swift exchange services.
Ann N.
Was sceptic to buy a lace blouse but after trying was very happy with the fit and style. Being slightly off white goes well with almost any kind of saree. Thank you suta
Eswari P.
Absolutely love everything from Suta. You people rock as always
asha T.
This is one of the best blouses from suta . It's so difficult to write a review for suta products as each one is so good that the review reads repetitive!!!
Perfect finish, cut and design !!!!
Any request for alteration is done meticulously!!!!!!
So ...thank you suta and team .
Arun S.
Hi 
Have not worn any of my purchases from you.
In the upcoming festive season , will wear them and then probably , will be able to write an honest review.
Rekha P.
Excellent. Perfect fitting. Loved it
Rama
It’s a beautiful blouse. Lovely crochet design, but fitting is a bit off this time. But still looks great!!
Sangeetha  S.
Got rave reviews for this blouse at office ..they found it unbelievable to get such a correct fitting..but I feel the padding could have been of better quality and should have given more cleavage cover ...overall comfort-5 stars!!Thank u suta...
Swagnika R.
Very sophisticated...pretty..love it
Sriparna D.
Neck is too deep. 
Had to fit similar color lace over .
Archana  M.
Torn defective product and no size available for replacement.

Had to buy another product compulsorily
Neetu C.
The blouse came torn and threads were out and it is not showing option to exchange now. Had bought with lot of expectations
Vijaya Chamundi M.
Exquisitely stichcrafted Lacy Macy blouse. Very soft fabric. I simply loved it. Packed specially in a suta printed cloth bag is appealing. Accompanied by facemask according to changed times is thought oriented.
Rasika G.
Great fitting!! Just I think the neckline is deep.but overall the fabric n stitching is best.i loved the lacy macy
Bharati S.
Not as good as other blouses I have bought. The scallops turn out. And the fit is not great too.
Kiran N.
Awesome comfortable
Dipanwita Rana  D.
Khub sundor..next time pore pic debo...ekhun sudhu pic dilam.... love you su ta,,
Shravanthi S.
Good fit and look
Nishita M.
Great styling and excellent fit!
Shantha N.
All the blouses are comfortable and are a fashion statement!
Sailaja K.
The blouse is as good as SuTA ...but I ordered it thinking it in white color but it's in cream color. So not able to match all thise sarees which need white blouse.
Anindita
The Suta blouses are awesome..
Puja P.
Wonderful fit, cleavage a bit deep. Maybe you could consider having more modest cleavages. But it has a lovely feminine feel
Aasha E.
I think I ordered the wrong size ! But the fabric of the blouse so so beautiful !
Lavangi S.
What a beautiful combination. The mul sari is extremely light and drapes beautifully. The Lacey Macey blouse was very comfortable as well. Love it SuTa.
Vijayalakshmi  P.
Lovely.
Sarmistha C.
Comfortable and chique... waiting for more colours
Arpita S.
Simply fell in love with it. Thank you SuTa!!!!
Shwetambari S.
The blouse fits perfectly. And what a relief from all the followup otherwise i need to do when i get it stiched from regular tailors. Thanka lot suta, definitely buying more of these treasures. Also everyone from my grandmother to my daughter loved how it looked on me.
Swati H.
I am so in love with your collection that I bought 3 more sarees from SUTA... giving my best wishes to both of u
Santoshi R.
Hi. The blouse is very delicate but pretty. The size I have ordered is a bit big for me for the sizes vary on different sites. I now know what to order next time. I have been regular on Suta and I am a fan.
Great going with the beautiful clothes.
Ranjitha B.
pricing is high for the quality of product
Jayashree R.
the blouse is very ipretty but the packing was bad! its lacy material and the hooks had pulled one some threads- so atleast wrapping each blouse with paper atleast and putting both into the same bag neatly instead of just stuffing it in would be a good thing to do!
Roushni A.
Super fun and so comfortable.
Shalini B.
It is beautiful
Chandana B.
Happy Diwali Suta..what to say about Lacy Macy..just fabulous
