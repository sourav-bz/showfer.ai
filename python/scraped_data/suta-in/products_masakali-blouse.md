Delivered defective product and no response yet on exchange
Nisha P.
The stiching is not right.. it has a huge gap under the armpit making a portion of my bra visible.
Bipasha B.
The size is too much big and the store asked for another Rs. 150 alteration for each piece!  And small is not small!
Parijat B.
Very Nice Blouse
Namita D.
I wanted non padded ..I didn't see it mentioned in the blouse description it being padded

Neena S.
Very nice fittings ...smart look ... fabric fantastic
srinivas m.
Blouse fitting and quality are good but I feel it's little bit expensive..
Vijayalakshmi N.
The medium size fitted very well
Himabindu M.
Fabric is good. Stich and finishing is flawless. But it was loose on me on sides. Blouse measurements can not be generalised liked S/M/L/XL and so on.. personalised adjustment option is even better. Other than that... Their , promotions , designs , fabric , finishing , everything else is very good.
Esther E.
Amazing fiting .
Evelyn A.
Paired it with your black mul cotton saree 
Was very good and comfortable
Bishalakhi G.
Getting the right of blouse, and here I talk about style, cut, stitching and material - has been a huge challenge ever since I have lived outside West Bengal.  When I found Suta , pretty much on a whim , just searching for a stylish match for a party , it seemed that my prayers of so many years got answered :-)  I love your designs, and the variety ! Only thing that bugged me was the return/replace but even that got done, quiet efficiently (had to write to you, couldn't find the option in the website thoh ) Anyway all together great experience and hoping to do more shopping soon! Wishing the Suta team many many success! Cheers!
Bishalakhi G.
It was a great experience !

Happy with the quality but not happy with the fitting.
Payal M.
Small size is perfectly fit ! Loved the designs n materials ❤️
Hema S.
My experience was not great. Blouse fit is not per size and experience with Suta customer service wasn't great as well. Even after making more than 20000 purchase they don't give alteration free of cost. This was my last purchase here.
Shobha N.
awesome
Sipra B.
Extremely friendly team members of Suta, apart from their classic designs and styles

Absolutely love this blouse....  This is my first sleeveless blouse so I was a little hesitant in wearing but pairing it with suta saree made it worth all the more... I am in love with all the suta products
Anuradha S.
Beautiful fit, makes you feel beautiful from inside
Ruchi  K.
Such a lovely fit
Saikat B.
Nice product
Ranjitha M.
My experience is horrible. Due to size issue, placed a replacement request. But replacement is not an easy process. Suta customer care asked to self ship due to courier partner pickup issue. Delivering product went smoothly but not replacement. Finally I asked to cancel replacement request.
If we don’t know correct fitting, better don’t go for it as replacement is not smooth
prachee m.
I was really really looking forward to wearing a Suta blouse, with expectations running high, based on the pictures and stories online. The first blouse I ordered  based on the size chart was way too big around my armholes. I emailed Suta and decided to order one size down. I learned that Rs. 150 would be deducted for each exchange, which I found unnecessary, since the blouse is priced pretty high. Anyway the one size down blouse fits better but one armhole is still bigger than the other, so I will need to get it altered. Rather disappointing. To have to spend money again to get a better fit is not a good ending.
Abanti S.
The fabric, the fit and the stitching- all much more than I had expected! This is my first blouse from Suta and I am
Looking forward to more!!

SMITA B.
very good fitting loved it.
Anala G.
This Blouse fitting is super awesome. But ladies with less bust should do a little extra fitting at home. I stitched my blouse 1/2 inch under my arms and the shoulder started dropping so I got black thread knots and stitched on the back which made a perfect fitting blouse. Thank you Su Ta.Love you.
Nandini G.
A perfect fit. Love the understated elegance.
Poulomi  R.
