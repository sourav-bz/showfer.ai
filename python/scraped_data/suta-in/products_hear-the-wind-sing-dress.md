Story
It was the holiday shed only read about in books and caught glimpses of in the movies. Shed often wondered what it would feel like “ to be footloose, fancy-free and completely oblivious to everyone and everything. To only listen to the whims of her wayward heart. The Vespa before her gleamed in the morning sun. To her, it was a symbol of the life shed always dreamed of. And one shed worked so hard to achieve.
So, she determinedly fixed the helmet over her cascading curls and fastened the straps below her chin. As the motor purred to life and the scooter bounced along the picturesque cobblestone paths, she could feel the world around her receding into a hazy blur. Every sound melted away and all she could hear was the rush of the wind. It was time to embark on new adventures. And, she was ready.
This white handloom cotton dress with delicate hand-embroidered detailing will be the perfect companion to your windswept adventures.

Description
Handloom cotton is handwoven by our weavers by hand on mechanical looms. The process is time and labour-intensive, using techniques that have been passed down across generations of artisans. The resultant fabric is extraordinarily soft, breathable and resilient, and also drapes very well. Using handloom cotton not only helps us to work with smaller weavers but also plays an important role in reducing the environmental footprint of the garments we produce. These dresses also feature delicate hand-embroidered details to make each piece truly memorable.

Shalvi S.
Such a beautiful flowy comfortable dress. I bough it in XS and I find it just a tad bit tight around my neck (in the front). But the size will easily fit someone with 14 inch shoulders, 34 chest and 28-30 waist.

Shed often wondered what it would feel like “ to be footloose, fancy-free and completely oblivious to everyone and everything. To only listen to the whims of her wayward heart.

And one shed worked so hard to achieve.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, she determinedly fixed the helmet over her cascading curls and fastened the straps below her chin. As the motor purred to life and the scooter bounced along the picturesque cobblestone paths, she could feel the world around her receding into a hazy blur.

The process is time and labour-intensive, using techniques that have been passed down across generations of artisans. The resultant fabric is extraordinarily soft, breathable and resilient, and also drapes very well. Using handloom cotton not only helps us to work with smaller weavers but also plays an important role in reducing the environmental footprint of the garments we produce. These dresses also feature delicate hand-embroidered details to make each piece truly memorable.\u003c\/p\u003e"}
