Story
The ink flowed slowly and quietly through the pen and reached the tip. She placed it on the paper and the ink started to spread with the slow confidence of drifting continents. She seemed to write carefully, for her wrist twirled with the grace of a dancer. There was no sign of recklessness because she knew that the effect of every word in the written form was irreversible. But, what she wrote was far from carefully curated words. She wrote her mind without inhibitions. The calmness of the pen and the raw, uninhibited words came together like gracefully slithering lava. This raw ink represented her very being.
The raw ink made-in-heaven mul saree is one of the most loved drapes at Suta. This one will make you wonder if you really are in saree-heaven!

Description

The mul cotton is what we call ˜made in heaven at Suta. Known in West Bengal as mul mul, the fabric is buttery soft and delicately beautiful. The weave of this fabric is very fine, and this lends a very fluid texture to it that makes draping it a breeze. It is truly like a hug that wraps you in its love!

Suchithra R.
I recently bought a saree & blouse(M size) from Suta, and I'm absolutely in love with it! The material is incredibly soft, making it comfortable to wear for long hours. The fall of the saree is just perfect, allowing it to drape beautifully and making it effortless to carry. I'm totally loving this purchase.

It's a very light weight, easy to carry saree.  It doesn't feel like you are wearing anything.  Now I want the under skirt and blouse also in the same material  The colour is vibrant, looks good.  My only concern is that Saree is so soft, it can get torn easily with pins or anything with edge.  Thank you for on time delivery and the nice packing.
