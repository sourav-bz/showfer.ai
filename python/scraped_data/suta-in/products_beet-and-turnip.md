Description
Cotton fabric dates back to some of the most ancient civilisations and it has a strong presence in the modern wardrobe as well. The softness and lightness of cotton combined with its strength and versatility makes it one of the most popular choices, especially for the Indian climate. We took this simple, elegant fabric and combined it with acrylic for that added sheen and voila! We love what we see and the saree falls so beautifully that it feels like second-skin! 
On the whole, this blend of fabric is 70% cotton, 30% acrylic and 100% amazing!

This saree is really lovely. It's very soft, but has a structure so it's easy to wear. The colour is divine and I recieved many compliments when I paired this with SUTA blouse 'Juliet Rose'. If you're tall then you're in luck because this saree has width so you have plenty of material to tuck in. I enjoyed wearing this saree.

So much
Sharmila  S.
In love with Suta products ♥️
Neha  K.
I'm in absolutely awe of the beautiful saree, it feels effortless to drape and style the fabric is so rich and beautiful! I would usually wear silk sarees (didn't like how it looked on me and how it felt) and wouldn't be happy with the drape the pleets were never set but this particular saree (and I'm sure all Suta sarees) drapped so well, I didn't have to use a single safety pin. 
Thank you Suta and team for all your thoughts and efforts for creating such a beautiful saree! A forever Suta fan ❤️
Archana  S.

Love the Saree. While the prestitched falls was a pleasant surprise, I would have preferred cotton falls, as the silk one makes the saree unwieldy, difficult to drape and and spoils the free flowing look.
