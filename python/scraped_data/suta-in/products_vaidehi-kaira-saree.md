Story 
Her family was content for Kaira to take up a secretarial position once she graduated. But the young firebrand had plans of her own. She didnt dream of matrimony and motherhood; she wanted to go out and forge a path of her own, study abroad and achieve great things as a scientist. With no support from her loved ones, she applied and was accepted into a top college in New York. It was a moment to be celebrated, but she was afraid. What would her family say? Would they shun her? Would she be able to face the world alone when everyone she loved had turned their backs on her? She was conflicted, but she knew that she had only one life. And it was up to her to celebrate it. So, she decided to embrace her Dear Zindagi and give it her best shot. She had earned it. She deserved it. And she was worth it.
May this purple saree made of handloom cotton and zari remind you to take charge of your own life. 
Description
Handloom cotton is handwoven by our weavers on mechanical looms. The process is time and labour-intensive, using techniques that have been passed down across generations of artisans. The resultant fabric is extraordinarily soft, breathable and resilient, and also drapes very well. Using handloom cotton not only helps us to work with smaller weavers but also plays an important role in reducing the environmental footprint of the garments we produce. The addition of zari adds a regal sheen to this saree, making it as beautiful as it is comfortable.

Umadevi R.
I am having more than ten SUTA sarees but this one I am disappointed threads are coming out not worth for the money
Dona D.
Sooo beautiful ❤️
Shweta M.
The saree is incredibly elegant and has a lovely, soft texture that is widely appreciated. I'm seeking advice on how to maintain the delicate golden threads within the saree. Unfortunately, they tend to unravel, making it challenging for me to handle them.
madhushri b.
The fabric was defective as the pictures show. Threads were coming out all over the saree. It can't be worn. When I let the customer support know, they said the saree is not defective and decided to close the ticket and not take any steps. I am shocked by their customer service. Will never buy from Suta again.
Shipra P.
Received a defective product.
Kavya C.

But the young firebrand had plans of her own. She didnt dream of matrimony and motherhood; she wanted to go out and forge a path of her own, study abroad and achieve great things as a scientist. With no support from her loved ones, she applied and was accepted into a top college in New York. It was a moment to be celebrated, but she was afraid. What would her family say? Would they shun her? Would she be able to face the world alone when everyone she loved had turned their backs on her? She was conflicted, but she knew that she had only one life. And it was up to her to celebrate it. So, she decided to embrace her Dear Zindagi and give it her best shot. She had earned it. She deserved it. And she was worth it.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay this purple saree made of handloom cotton and zari remind you to take charge of your own life. \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eDescription\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHandloom cotton is handwoven by our weavers on mechanical looms. The process is time and labour-intensive, using techniques that have been passed down across generations of artisans. The resultant fabric is extraordinarily soft, breathable and resilient, and also drapes very well. Using handloom cotton not only helps us to work with smaller weavers but also plays an important role in reducing the environmental footprint of the garments we produce. The addition of zari adds a regal sheen to this saree, making it as beautiful as it is comfortable.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cstyle type=\"text\/css\"\u003e\u003c!--\ntd {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}\n--\u003e\u003c\/style\u003e\n\u003cstyle type=\"text\/css\"\u003e\u003c!--\ntd {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}\n--\u003e\u003c\/style\u003e"}
