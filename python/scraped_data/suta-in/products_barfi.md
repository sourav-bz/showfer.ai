Story
The magic of rain can grace parched summer scenes when the heart is pure. The far-away bird can tell stories of lands from the beyond when the heart is pure. That candy bar that she shared with the lonely kid can fill her tummy when the heart is pure.The flyaway-petals of the wild white Lantana can turn into snow showers of glee when the heart is pure.
This pure white saree made of Eucalyptus and Made in Heaven mul yarns is simply magical. This will easily make it to your list of favourites!
Description
When it comes to fabrics, there is a history of many types of fabrics that have been used since the dawn of the first civilizations. Some of these fabrics have weathered the changes in time and are still among the most used fabrics even today. While such fabrics and weaves have an undeniable old-world charm, at the other end of the spectrum there are some wonderful fabrics that are products of new-age innovation. These fabrics are developed with the challenges of the present world in mind while also retaining the allure of conventional fabrics. Suta sarees are now made fluid with modal which is a nature based fabric. Sarees made with modal fabric acquire a soft drape and luxurious sheen making you look stylish while keeping you absolutely comfortable. It is fashion so fluid, that when you move, it moves with you.
Modal products are nature based made from fibres extruded from wood, like birch, eucalyptus etc., which is sustainable, renewable and from responsible sources. They have the lowest ecological footprint. It is made using significantly lesser natural resources than other fibres, with a lower impact on the environment.
At Suta, we have taken this piece of innovation and made it into our very own fabric by combining modal yarn and made-in-heaven mul yarn together to create a very special product. The coming together of a new-age yarn and the most loved mul yarn is truly a magical thing and the outcome is spectacular. Good clothes are meant to not just make you look good but also make you feel good from inside and this eco-friendly twist to your favourite mul saree will achieve exactly that!
So update your wardrobe with this exclusive modal sarees and experience natural fluid fashion.

Chandana J.
Material is so poor,disappointing and in comparision,the price,so high.if there is any return policy,pl inform!
ALKA P.
Nice as expected... But blouse piece should be there
Neha M.
It's so elegant and the feel is also amazing... Always was in love with suta Sarees...
Frances  M.
I wanted a pure white sari and Suta delivered! I ordered the Barfi sari, and it is luscious, elegant, soft, supple and drapes gracefully. True to Suta's standards, this sari satisfies my every need. Many thanks to the Suta Company for providing the most beautiful sarees I own!
Frances  M.
I asked for 100% pure mul cotton, but I got something that is not 100% cotton. The sari is gorgeous and supple, but it has synthetic threads woven into it. So although it is pretty, and crafted very beautifully, it is not what I wanted. It is slippery and too hot to wear in the summertime. I am surprised that you sent me a sari that is not like what you had sent me before. The sarees you have sent me in the past were pure, 100% mul cotton, perfectly beautiful, soft and breathable. I am disappointed that this time you sent me a sari that is not 100% mul cotton. I hope you will not disappoint me in the future when I ask for 100% pure mul cotton.
