Story
The pretty pink always spoke to her, right from when she had first laid eyes on it at the candy store when she was 4. It told her magical tales, it brought out that sparkle in her eyes and it became her colour. Years later, when she indulges in her favourite cotton candy amidst a group of her œadult friends, she whispers a hi to pink and she becomes 4 again!
This pink beauty of a blouse in artificial silk is so elegant!

SUTAB352A
Description

India is one of the top producers of silk in the world and the fabric is always in demand for its visual attractiveness. People associate silk with special occasions and richness. Silk is alluring and can boast of a grand appeal as well as a tinge of nostalgia. On the whole, silk is a fabric that can never go wrong. This artificial silk fabric is made with synthetic fibres that look and feel like silk while making the luxurious experience of silk affordable to all.

Bold yet Classic!
Surabhi A.
I ordered 8 blouses from US to an Indian address, out of which I received only 3 in 1 shipment. The rest of the shipment with 5 blouses was never delivered. After multiple emails also, I am yet to receive an update or even refund. Such bad service and ghosting on clients is not expected by a reputed site.
Ruchita J.
Plzzz restock this product of size S
Jayanthi V.
Excellent fit
Prema P.
Bought it for my younger daughter and she wore it with happiness. The cut, fit(maybe slight tightening is required) and material is good. Unfortunately I have no proper pictures as her hair has covered the blouse.
Aarthie J.
Thank you
Ellora D.
We love your products. ... we find your photo-shoot quirky and products very personalized .... you guys are handling it  beautifully.
Kasturi G.
Perfect fit and pairs so well with my Suta sarees. Great quality too, doesn’t lose colour on washing.
Sonam J.
The blouse quality and stitching are good but it did not fit well from the bust and the neck. It had a gaping neckline though I ordered the blouse true to my size. I wish it would have fitted me better because the blouse, though a bit expensive, is of good quality. Suta, please take note.
Kataria D.
Returned the product as size was incorrect, tried to contact Suta helpline, never got any response, do not no when the exchange  or refund will take place.
Kavita P.
Perfect fit - considering I bought a generic fit.
Laxmi S.
I ordered the size based on the size chart but unfortunately it is not fitting me. I was not able to order the exchange and i was getting error. I did message but no response so far.
Sai Pooja A.
Needed a well stitched blouse on short nice to pair with a Kanjeevaram saree. Thought of Suta so I purchased my first suta blouse the gulabi and it reached me within two days and fit me perfectly. No alterations, no hassles, great fit and perfect pairing.
Rashmi T.
Blouse quality is good... fitting is good..... colour is beautiful can go with different colours of sarees.Good purchase....Go for it Girls!!!
Sonia M.
Fits me perfectly. Bought it from the newly opened store in Kolkata. friendly staff and they helped me with the alteration. My last minute saviour!
Ananya S.
versatile and smart!
SUDIPTA G.
The blouse fits like a glove. Amazing fit and fabric is great too. Fantastic experience for a readymade blouse.
Sarbari R.
Tried it on and it fits very well. The look is stylish and modern
Arpita K.
Quality and fitting were nice. But it’s bit longer than expected.
Kruti V.
I had this blouse customised for me. Since I live abroad and I was visiting India  just for a few days, the order had to be express ready and delivered on time. After a few hiccups along the way I got my blouse on time and am very happy with it. The customer service was very good and my contact person did her very best to ensure that I had the product in time. Thank you for that!!
I would however say, for international customers who want things customised,  the procedure online can be improved.  
All in all I am a very happy customer and would definitely recommend Suta.
Sagarika M.
I have a number of Suta products now. So allow me to request the blouses be made not only with diff chest sizes, but also a permutation of different cup sizes. Eg, my cup size is large but chest size medium. 
Everything else about the product is excellent
Prity S.
I really like the stitching craftsmanship. However it would have better if lining was cotton. Size runs large to its true size.
Mansi  S.
It’s really very good & fitting is really very good
Jasmine S.
Ordered L size but found the fit not perfect, the Suta team was very prompt and cooperative in accepting an exchange for XL size and delivered it in time for Diwali, good quality at affordable price.
Anupama A.
I love the way it fits me and make me feel super sexy 

Looking forward to buying more soon

The blouse, like all blouses from Suta, fits like a dream. I now have 3 colors in these ‘Basic’ blouses. Love love love them.
Shefali M.
Loved the fit and colour of the blouse.. Appreciate the spontaneous response and fast delivery.
TRISHITA G.
This was my first purchase from Suta, also the first online purchase of a blouse as I was always sceptical about the fitting. But my mind was blown after receiving the blouse.. It is simply perfect both in quality and fit. And special mention should go to the love and care taken to pack the item. A big thumbs up to Suta.
Neetima Y.
It was amazing  fit and comfort.
Prachi K.
Loved it. Fitted really well. Thank you so much for creating this website
Kinjal B.
I ordered XS which was still a bit loose for me, however it was easy to get it altered. The hot pink color and the material are both superb.
Priya W.
Too loss and not fit it well
Shradha J.
Loved it
Jayalakshmi  S.
Hi I bought two basic blouses - yellow and pink both in XS.The straps are of different width and the cup sizes are different. A friend of mine recieved it in Mumbai on my behalf and brought it over for me to London so I don’t even have the option of sending the pink one back. Is it common to have such differences in sizes ?
Shagufta J.
The color which is shown in the picture is a lot lighter than what the color actually is.
This can create confusion for buyer
Shruthi B.
Beautiful quality and fit
Arpana A.
Amazing!
Madhurima G.
Blouse fits perfectly
Savinta  C.
Thank you sute for the wonderful quality. You have very unique collection at a reasonable price. Love from Mauritius ♥️
Jonaki  S.
The material of the blouse was exactly the colour and texture that I expected it to be from the photographs on the website. I was also totally suprised by how exactly it conformed to the measurements given for that size. My waist size is in between that of the medium and large sized blouse and that is why true to my expectation the large size it a little lose at the waist. Otherwise though it fits really well and looks gorgeous. I am now thinking of buying an appropriate saree to go with it!
Jhelum N.
Fit is even better than made to measure blouses. Perfect companion to Suta sarees and more ❤️
Komal S.
Perfect fit, timely delivery.
Snehal B.
6 colours I bought and all are awesome
Mamta S.
I ordered a bigger size. So I had to get it exchanged and the Mumbai store didn't have a pink blouse in my size. But everyone on the phone and the Mumbai staff were very helpful
Shayonee  B.
The bra cup should be further down.
Promita D.

Loved it. Looking forward to grab a few more
Sebanti  B.
Love the colour (true to the pictures displayed) and the fact that so much care has been taken in stitching the blouse. I had ordered a size L which did not fit me too well. So now I have ordered an M for 2 fresh purchases and am keeping my fingers crossed that they work!
Vidya  N.
Buying from Suta is not shopping it’s an experience!
Really love the words , write for every artefact , gives that experience and makes us feel so special 

This blouse was a like tailor fit ! 
Looks amazing
Hiral G.
Suta has always been my priority when it comes to blouses or sarees that too when I am a no saree person.I really keep getting confused to choose and wish could own every single piece.Love you guys.keep making more and more lovely drapes.
Sunita J.
Nice colour
Ananya S.
I combined the Gulabi Basic Blouse  with the Sunflower Saree. Suta brings me so much joy!
Sriparna  C.
Great quality of material. Only that the armhole was too big for me and didnt give a great fit. Nothing a little local tailor's expertise couldn't solve.
Maybe go for a smaller bust size and then have it restitched as there is plenty of material on the sides.
Also, I wish Suta had better Return/Exchange policy for these not Made to Order items.
Looking forward to trying more items.
Anu U.
The blouse fit so well . Loved it .
