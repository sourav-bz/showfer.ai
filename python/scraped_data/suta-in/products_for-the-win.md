Story
Dear Diary,
Do you know how whenever you watch a movie or a show thats set in Mumbai, they invariably include a clip about the famous local trains? Well, today I decided to take the ultimate test that all true Mumbaikars must go through - I took the train. But before that, I did my research. It turns out that afternoons work the best, followed by late at night to beat the crowds. So, at 9 pm, I bought myself a round ticket to the farthest station from my house and hopped on. I have to admit that, at first, I was a little sceptical. I mean, what could possibly be special about a train ride? How different would it be to any other mode of public transport? But as the journey progressed, I realised that my train compartment was its own ecosystem. It had witnessed the formation of many new friendships, seen many tempers flare and subside, and the beginning and end of many stories. Many hopefuls had taken this same train to important interviews, many lovers to reach their soulmates, many to their ailing loved ones that needed them urgently, many to their places of work, worship and rest. Similarly, my story would find its place amongst the many clothes, woven into a seamless collage of old and new.
Question your perceptions when youre wearing this gorgeous red and pink cotton dress.

Well, today I decided to take the ultimate test that all true Mumbaikars must go through - I took the train. But before that, I did my research. It turns out that afternoons work the best, followed by late at night to beat the crowds. So, at 9 pm, I bought myself a round ticket to the farthest station from my house and hopped on. I have to admit that, at first, I was a little sceptical. I mean, what could possibly be special about a train ride? How different would it be to any other mode of public transport? But as the journey progressed, I realised that my train compartment was its own ecosystem. It had witnessed the formation of many new friendships, seen many tempers flare and subside, and the beginning and end of many stories. Many hopefuls had taken this same train to important interviews, many lovers to reach their soulmates, many to their ailing loved ones that needed them urgently, many to their places of work, worship and rest. Similarly, my story would find its place amongst the many clothes, woven into a seamless collage of old and new.  \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestion your perceptions when youre wearing this gorgeous red and pink cotton dress.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cstrong data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eDescription\u003c\/strong\u003e\n\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cp data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eOne of the most popular natural fibres in the world, cotton is hailed for its beauty, comfort, durability and versatility.
