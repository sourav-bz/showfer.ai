Story
As a little girl she was always fascinated with colours! colours of the sky just before sunset, colours of the green that always seemed to vary from tree to tree, colours of her changing heart when she knew she was falling in love! But before she came to know that fluttering red of love, she knew it wasn't gonna last forever. So she counted each day as if it was their first and last day in love, she preserved every moment as though it was turning into a memory, but she made sure she savoured every bit of it for as long as it lasted. Here's to a merry everything and a happy always!
The Basic Baingani is not just one colour for a season, it's an amalgamation of all those beautiful feelings and more!

Description
Silk exudes a regality that very few other fabrics can match. The brilliant shine that vibrates from a silk saree spells class and traditional beauty. India is one of the top producers of silk in the world and the fabric is always in demand for its visual attractiveness. People associate silk with special occasions and richness. Silk is alluring and can boast of a grand appeal as well as a tinge of nostalgia. On the whole, silk is a fabric that can never go wrong. This artificial silk fabric is made with synthetic fibres that look and feel like silk while making the luxurious experience of silk affordable to all.

I had ordered the wrong size and was still very  impressed by the quality .
However when the right size came in , I was not impressed with the sewing quality . How does one piece stitching vary from the other ???
Bhavani D.
What can I say..it fit exactly as if my measurements were taken to stitch the blouse and got so many compliments for this one. Simple yet elegant, love this blouse. Ordered more blouses after this one. If a customer returns that means the purchase was satisfactory and for this was way more than satisfactory. Love you guys!
