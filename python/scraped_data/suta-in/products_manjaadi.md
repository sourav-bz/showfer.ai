Story 
Her earliest memories were of visiting the park in their neighbourhood for playtime. Every evening, shed make a beeline for the park where she and her friends would spend an hour chasing each other through the trees. Then, theyd catch their breaths under a tree and invariably get drawn to the bright red seeds that were strewn under it. For her, that was one of the most special parts of the evenings “ the seeds seemed like priceless rubies. She had amassed quite a robust collection of them before other distractions caught her fancy. However, on a recent visit Kochi, she discovered a manjaadi tree, just like the one she played under as a child, in her courtyard. Pausing for a moment, she marvelled at the bright red seeds and then swooped down to gather a few. As she held them in her palm, a wave of nostalgia hit her. It felt as though she was magically transported to the carefree summers of her youth, where life was simple and she felt invincible. She took home a couple of the seeds as a way of preserving that feeling for a little longer.
Wearing this lovely cream mul zari saree with a red and gold border will make you the lucky charm of your life.
Description
Our ˜made in heaven mul cotton, is also known as mul mul in West Bengal. The fabric is buttery soft and has a delicate beauty. Its weave is very fine and this lends a very fluid texture to the fabric, which makes draping it a breeze. It truly is like a hug that wraps you in its love. The addition of zari adds a regal sheen to this saree, making it as beautiful as it is comfortable.

sulekha s.
had ordered two sarees from the onam collection. not sure if it was a mistake but both sarees came in the same cloth bag. guess it was obvious one of them was a gift and i could have used the cloth bag to store the lovelies.
no point saving a cloth bag right!

Rajini A.
Colour is not matching
Tavleen  K.
The fabric is not very good. It’s way too light and seems like it will tear easily. Disappointed with the way it was delivered as well. Wasn’t even ironed, looked like some old saree hurriedly being folded and sent off. I’m not sure if the saree is not good because it’s pre stitched. Spending more than 5k and getting this quality is just sad. Will think twice before ordering anything again.
Suma R.
Extremely soft and beautiful the red adds a pop of color to it making it even more beautiful
Sonia S.
Not a fan of the material

Amazing Saree... Totally in love with this saree Go for it girls
Shruti V.
Excellent quality & soft. Lovely details like the tassels and thin red stripe. I wore it at an embassy event while performing the Indian and Hungarian national anthems. It was perfect to represent Hungarian colours as well as an Indian aesthetic :)
Deepa  P.
I like the material... but the color could be more white side instead of cream color.
Shalini R.
Colour is dull compared to pics. Quality is bad.
Kamal W.
Excellent
Neena  D.
Absolutely overwhelmed to have the beautiful saree.
Gopakumar N.
I bought it for my daughter and I truly believe that she would love it. I am awed by the softness and the texture of the material. It is a classic saree and can be worn with a traditional blouse for a traditional/conservative look or paired with a modern blouse - sphagetti or halter neck blouse. I am extremely happy with it. Will definetly come back for more
Priya R.
Loved draping the sari - quick wear! It was quite soft and so comfortable to wear for the whole day. Onam was indeed very special for me! So many admired the sari and the texture. Referred to many friends. It's worth the money! I was short of time else I would have got a blouse too from Suta. :)
Deepa K.
From start to finish the ordering process was smooth and the delivery was faster than expected.  The saree was a gift,  so I haven't seen it myself.  But I'm told that the wearer loved it and the feel is like no other.  Looking forward to possessing sarees from Suta.
Neeta P.
Awesome saree
Jayashree  P.
Saree is very soft and lightweight, awesome fabric and soothing feeling. Thanks suta

Dr Dhanya  V.
This saree was jst superb..it was my first purchase and I was extremely happy with the purchase ..I suggest this saree to all saree lovers..it was easy to drape and then was simply awesome.
Sulekha R.
Love this saree! It looks stunning, but my favourite part is that the malmal is so soft, it takes the shape of your body. It doesn't bunch up at all.
Customer
Simply love the saree and can't wait to drape it and flaunt it again and again.  It is classy and elegant. However, it could be a little more thick and stiff and less transparent. Nevertheless, it is beautiful and commendable. Thank you, Suta! ♥️
Supria P.
Hi, I like the saree but as once before the shade in the picture and the in real are quite different.  In the picture it is more on the whiter side whereas in reality it is cream.  I know that you guys take the pictures in daylight and because of the camera the shade could be different from the actual one but in this case it really is way off from the picture.  Anyway I do like your sarees, so keep up the good work.
Pooja  A.
It was a very bad first time experience shopping with Suta. The saree looks absolutely different from the one shown in promotions in terms of colour and texture. And the biggest issue is that suta has refused to take back the product
Urvashi S.
I bought this beautiful piece for onam celebrations at my workplace .I got so many compliments for this saree that day. The touch and feel of this fabric is as soft as cotton. I was absolutely feeling light and free. Thank u Suta❤️
Anubha N G.
All good. Sari shopping was smooth. 
Some feedback:
- need better information on material and how it falls, material care and so on
- would appreciate timely WhatsApp help in this regard. Your WhatsApp chats are all one way. No answers to my questions 

When sale goes smooth all is good. However, if there is a problem, one feels there might be complicated to get returns, help etc
Lavanya A.
Most beautiful saree
Sarika S.
Amazing product as shown as image just soft and gorgeous matterials i have ever seen i also loved the saree
Siva J.
Beautiful saree and I loved it

Drawback: since it is so beautiful, I could see many of my friends also having similar sarees
Rinal P.
बहोत बढीया मैटीरियल... Love it❤️

Suta की ये मेरी purchase की हुइ आठवीं साड़ी है... Soft ness की वजह से मुझे ये बहुत पसंद है।
Sasidharan P.
Thank you received the product …. Beautiful saree
Sreelekha M.
Love love love. I have probably been debating about buying this Saree since it was first introduced on this site — couldn’t make up my mind because of some of the negative reviews though only very few. (I am on this quest for that one of a kind yet beautiful kasavu Saree which still continues) but finally, I decided to go for it and I am glad I did. End of the day, it’s a most simple kasavu Saree but the material and the perfect ‘kodi’ and red color really elevates it. Got lots of compliments!
Aditya G.
The saree was amazing! It felt so soft, and the elegance was on point. Big thanks for helping make our special moments even more memorable!
Neeru S.
Its feel good and i love ur collection
Monmi B.
I love the quality, very soft cotton.
Kiran T.
Beautiful color soft texture 
Though after sometime it was it little difficult to manage, overall and nice saree my fourth purchase from suta.
Dipa P.
The saree looks much grander on the pic . It’s isn’t that grand when you actually see it. Keep that in mind while ordering . Quality is decent .
Mamatha S.
I bought this saree to drape goddess Lakshmi for varalakshmi Pooja.....such a lovely saree .... showered with praise for the choice of my saree... It's simple..yer looks classy n elegant....
Radhapriyadharsini V.
Saree is so soft❤️ and lovely colour combination
