### Frequently Asked Questions

Is Origin Nutrition protein shake a good meal replacement?

Yes. Based on your daily nutrition requirements, macros and exercise levels, you can use Origin Nutrition protein shake as a meal replacement, or anytime during the day. However, for a completely balanced meal, we recommend a good mix of vegetables, good carbs from your favourite fruits and healthy fats like nuts and seeds.

How much protein do I need?

As per the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI), the required amount is 0.8 gms of protein per kg of body weight. But that could differ from person to person based on activity level, age and current health condition. Although 0.8 gms of protein might be sufficient to prevent deficiency in an average sedentary person, your requirement could be higher or lower. Try our Protein Calculator to understand how much protein is best suited to your lifestyle.

As a vegetarian, how can I get the right amount of protein?

As per the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI), the required amount is 0.8 gms of protein per kg of body wVegetarian diets are generally considered healthy due to good amounts of fibre. But they can lack the required amounts of protein as whole foods don’t contain enough quantities. Based on your daily activity levels and lifestyle, vegan protein powders can help supplement your protein requirements, and give you that extra boost through the day.

Will Origin Nutrition Protein help me lose weight?

As per the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI), the required amount is 0.8 gms of protein per kg of body Weight loss is about creating a calorie deficit. And that means the total calories you spend in a day should be higher than the total calories you consume. That said, a high-protein diet definitely helps with weight loss. An Origin Nutrition protein shake can keep you satiated through the day, and also energise your evening run!
