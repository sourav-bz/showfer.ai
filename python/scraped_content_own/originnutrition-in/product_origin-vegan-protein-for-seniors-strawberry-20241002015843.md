Very new to taking supplements so didn't know what to expect. But I tried Biotin and it was so great! The flavour was good and I was relieved that all the ingredients were 100% natural. That's the only reason I bought from this brand.

It’s the best protein powder I’ve had. Most of the whey proteins have a bad reaction with my body resulting in bloating. My body has settled in very well with this protein. It’s a must try!
