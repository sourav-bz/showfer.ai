Tastes wonderful! You got a forever customer.

[Daily Plant Protein Powder - Mango Mania (Jar)](https://originnutrition.in/product/daily-vegan-plant-protein-powder-mango-mania-jar/)

Switched from Unived Pea Protein (after 2 years) as they have only one flavour that tastes really bad. I was searching for alternatives when I stumbled upon TheLiverDoc's report about Origin Nutrition and decided to give their Mango flavour  a try, and I absolutely love it. 

I have a powerful Vitamix blender where I add 20 almonds (soaked overnight unpeeled), 2 walnut kernels, 4-5 cashwes, 2 scoops of Mango Mania powder, 2 dried figs, one banana). Can't describe how it tastes! Thanks Origin!

I suffer from IBS and I have tried various whey as well as plant protein brands. But I was unable to tolerate them. But Origin's Unflavoured Protein is a true gem for me. It helped me achieve my everyday protein goals without any hassle. I really loved the taste and texture, even though it was unflavoured.

After consistently using Origins vegan protein for 6 months i can surely say it is a really a fantastic product and a great way to supplement protein in a vegetarians diet! I really love how easy it is on the stomach unlike whey and how it helps me improve my strength in the workouts and has no side effects! I feel much stronger and healthier than ever before! My only request would be to lower the prices a little bit to make it more affordable for the middle class public! Keep up the good work!

Within a week I recieved a refund and a replacement of the protein jar..! They also sent a shaker and a mojo pop packet for free. Quite the unthinkable, I'm ecstatic at their service. Will surely order again.

That really is a wow moment because your brain is still processing the lovely texture and taste and then the sensory crunch while still wondering... what, no potato, really? If that were not enough, it's not fried or baked either. Way too much to expect from chips, in a very amazing way. :))))) Bye potato!

Finally a great protein supplement option!

[Daily Plant Protein  - Strawberry (Jar)](https://originnutrition.in/product/daily-vegan-plant-protein-powder-strawberry-jar/)

I’ve been using Origin for a year now and absolutely love it!  Being a vegetarian with a hectic schedule, it has been a challenge to incorporate enough protein into my diet. After being disappointed with many protein powders on the market, I’m so glad to have found Origin. It’s a great balance of both clean ingredients as well as taste. Origin bas become an integral part of my lifestyle and is a great on the go option. I use it in my kids shakes too and it has made a huge difference! ????/????

I recently tried Origin Nutrition, a protein supplement that comes highly recommended by the well-known TheLiverDoc. After seeing a tweet from LiverDoc about being best plant protein, I just had to try it for myself - and I'm glad I did!

This protein supplement has an outstanding taste, and is easily one of the best-tasting plant supplements I've ever tried. The website is also beautifully designed and user-friendly, which makes ordering and learning more about the product a breeze.

I was very much satisfied by this purchase and looking forward to using it daily. ????/

It’s great for smoothies and milkshakes

[Daily Plant Protein - Vanilla](https://originnutrition.in/product/origin-vegan-plant-protein-powder-vanilla/)

The flavour of this product is nice and subtle – it has a heady vanilla scent, but the taste isn't overpowering and it's not too sweet, so it's great for smoothies or milkshakes as it won't overwhelm other ingredients. The powder dissolves quickly and easily in water without creating lumps, but if you like a thicker shake, it's best mixed with milk. It is on the more expensive side as compared to the other powders but if you're not a fan of strong, overly sweet shakes, it might be a sound invest

Cleanest & tastiest protein blend ever

[Daily Plant Protein - Strawberry](https://originnutrition.in/product/origin-vegan-plant-protein-powder-strawberry/)

I was searching for the protein with palatable taste, clean & organic ingredients, budget friendly, sweetened with natural sweetener, no added gums & artificial flavours. I spent almost half a week in reading about so many brands & their reviews. Finally I came across the ad on instagram about Origin Nutrition brand. I read about it & decided to try. And to my surprise, this protein blend turn out to be the best among all the other protein blends. I fell in love with the taste & the smell.

Delicious Chocolate Vegan Proteins

[Daily Plant Protein - Chocolate](https://originnutrition.in/product/origin-vegan-plant-protein-powder-chocolate/)

So easy to add to your daily diet by having it as a simple smoothie or even using it in cooking! The unflavoured one opens up a lot of possibility to not be stuck to always having to drink your proteins. Good stuff guys!

Absolutely Fantastic Vegan Protein

[Daily Plant Protein - Chocolate](https://originnutrition.in/product/origin-vegan-plant-protein-powder-chocolate/)

Great vegan protein! I truly like the way how the protein can be added in baking recipes, milkshakes and even rotis. Everybody in my family really enjoys the protein and chocolate is the favourite amongst us.
