# Can Plant Protein Aid in Building Muscle?

Plant-based protein can be used to build muscle instead of traditional protein sources like whey protein. However, there are some potential drawbacks to getting your protein from plants rather than animal sources. These challenges are not intended to discourage athletes from consuming plant-based protein sources. Once you’re aware of the potential stumbling blocks, you can take steps to avoid them and maximize your muscle gains. The following are some of the ways to build muscle through plant-based protein sources:

1. Know the source of your protein:

As previously stated, not all plant-based protein sources are equal. Some plant-based proteins are complete, while others lack essential amino acids. If you want to start incorporating more plant-based proteins into your diet, you should be aware of the types of proteins you’re eating. Certain plant-based proteins are higher in amino acids and nutrients than others. Pea protein, Soy protein, brown rice protein, Fava bean protein and Quinoa protein are some of the major sources of plant proteins. You can, however, combine them with other sources to make a complete protein and get more nutrients in a single meal or snack.

1. Pick the right plant based protein powder:

Finding a high-quality plant-based protein powder to replace your daily whey or casein protein is critical. There are numerous plant-based protein powder options available on the market. However, not all of them provide the same nutritional benefits. Some of the most important factors to consider when looking for a plant-based protein powder are protein sources, amino acid content, taste, and texture. If you keep these factors in mind, you’ll be less likely to experience the digestive issues, flavor issues, and performance issues that many people experience when consuming plant-based protein powder.

1. Track your protein intake:

If your primary goal is to gain muscle, it’s critical that you keep track of your protein intake. You must be aware of how much protein you consume each day. It’s easy to assume you’re getting enough protein and then, after a closer look at your diet, realize you’re lacking in the protein department. There are numerous apps available to help you calculate how much protein you consume on a daily basis. Make sure you’re being precise with your protein tracking as well. Don’t make educated guesses about how much you’re eating or drinking at each meal or snack. Weigh and measure your food so you know exactly how much you’re consuming.

1. Be consistent:

Consistency is another important aspect of building muscle on a plant-based diet. Athletes who want to make progress in the gym must be consistent in their workouts as well as their nutrition. Of course, what you eat and do matters, but how you do them matters even more. If you don’t lift on a regular basis, track your food, and hit your goals on a consistent basis, you’ll struggle to see the results you want.

1. Don’t Under Eat:

Finally, when trying to build muscle, don’t forget to eat enough food. It’s important to meet your protein goal, but you’ll also need to meet your daily calorie goal. You won’t be able to build muscle and see good results if you’re undereating and in a calorie deficit. It makes no difference how much weight you lift or how much protein you consume. This is another situation where keeping track of your daily food and beverage intake is beneficial. You can meet all of your macronutrient and calorie goals if you use an app as well as precisely weigh or measure your food.

As you can see, building muscle with plant-based protein is definitely possible. There’s no reason why you can’t make progress and stick to your diet if you eat high-quality plant-based protein sources and exercise consistently. None of the plant-based protein powders available compete with Origin Nutrition’s vegan protein powder. It’s ideal for improving performance and maximizing muscle growth because it’s made with a combination of Pea protein and pumpkin seeds.
