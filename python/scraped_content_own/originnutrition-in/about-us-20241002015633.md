# About us

It all began with a quest. Chirag was looking for a clean, tasty, nutritious protein that was good on the tummy and happy for the soul. But this quest was not without challenges. Being lactose-intolerant was a major hurdle, especially when you’re born in a dairy-loving Punjabi family!

He discovered how vegan protein had impressive effects on his diet and body, but then had to battle irregular markets, unreliable availability, inferior quality and unreasonable prices. In true entrepreneur fashion, he was spurred on to find a better solution. Fortunately, the answer was close to home!

Aditi, backed by years of managing a food business, suggested a practical approach – if we can’t find it, let’s make it! And so, after many trials, errors and striving to create that perfectly balanced taste, Origin Nutrition was born. The journey from inspiration to impact has been long but worthwhile. Origin nails taste tests like no other in the market. With Aditi’s food formulation experience and Chirag’s business acumen, Origin is on its way to making the world a happier place. A great love story if there ever was one!

## We care about you. And our community too.

*

By choice and circumstance, our manufacturing unit in Chennai is an all-women unit, a significant cause that’s particularly close to our founders’ hearts. Aware of the huge employment challenges that many women face in the country, Aditi and Chirag were determined to create a positive impact on the local community. So, that delicious taste you get also means happy faces for us.

### Chirag Gupta

The catalyst

The ‘brainwave’, not just the brains of the Origin family, Chirag doesn’t just dream of a happier world, he makes it happen. Co-founder and health buff, he believes that the proof is in the pudding. Sometimes, literally! From sourcing to delivery, Chirag gets it done! He enjoys his everyday workout, loves quiet early mornings and to-do lists, and is a serial “email checker”! But he starts it all with a strawberry Origin protein shake for breakfast! It’s his favourite flavour, but he may never admit it! Connect with Chirag on LinkedIn.
