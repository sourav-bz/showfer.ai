We aim to refund you within 12 business days of the product being returned to DECIEM, however, these times may be impacted during high volume periods.

All returns will be credited to the original method of payment. We cannot process your refund to an alternative card. The refund will be issued upon processing of the returned product(s). You will receive an email notification upon completion of return processing.

## Fair Use

If we notice an abnormal pattern of return activity or behaviour then we may connect with you about your returns.

Any abuse of the return policy can result in the suspension of the account and any associated accounts. If this has happened to you, and you think we’ve made a mistake, contact our Customer Happiness team and we’ll be happy to review it with you. If your account has been suspended and you need to make a return, contact our Customer Happiness team before sending any products back.

DECIEM maintains the right to determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, whether you are entitled to a refund and, if so, the amount of the refund you are eligible to receive. DECIEM reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to refuse to provide a refund or accept your Order for any reason – including, but not limited to, if we deem your Order to be suspicious or fraudulent in any way.
