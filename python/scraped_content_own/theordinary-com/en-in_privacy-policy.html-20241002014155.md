## Technologies We Use

### Cookies, Web Server Logs and Web Beacons

Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or other Internet-connected device to
            uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser. Your browser may tell
            you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies and how to restrict or disable certain
            cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our
            Website. For details on these types of cookies and information on how to opt-out, click here.

In conjunction with obtaining information through cookies, our web servers may log details such as your
            operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system
            uses and the country and time zone in which your device is located. The web server logs also may record
            information such as the address of the web page that linked you to our Website and the IP address of the
            device you use to connect to the Internet.

To control which web servers collect this information, we may place tags on our webpages called “web
            beacons.” These are computer instructions that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies.

### Third Party Web Analytics Services

We may use third party web analytics services on our Website such as Google Analytics. The service providers
            that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to help us
            analyze how visitors use our Website. The information collected through these means (including IP address)
            is anonymized before being shared with these service providers, who use the information to evaluate use of
            the Website. You may deactivate the ability of these analytics services to analyze your browsing activities
            on the Website. If you would like to opt-out from the use of your information by Google Analytics, you may
            use Google’s Analytics opt-out browser add-on designed for this purpose.

### Targeted Advertising

We also may contract with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information
            through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons on our Website and emails; on third-party
            websites and emails; and on our advertising placed on third-party websites. They use this information to
            provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests (including for companies not
            affiliated with us). You may see these advertisements on our Website and other websites. This process also
            helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To not have your information shared
            with such parties, you may manage your cookie preferences here, or by going to our "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" web page.

## How We Use the Information Collected by Automated Means

We may use the information collected through automated means on our Website for market research, data
            analytics and system administration purposes, such as to determine whether you have visited us before or are
            new to the Website, to tailor ads displayed to you on our Website and elsewhere and for compliance with our
            legal obligations, policies and procedures, including compliance with relevant industry standards. We also
            may use the information in other ways for which notice is provided at or before the time of collection.

## Do Not Track

We currently do not change our tracking practices in response to “do-not-track” signals or other similar
            mechanisms. “Do-not-track” is a privacy preference that you can set in your web browser to indicate that you
            do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected across websites when you have not
            interacted with that service on the page. For details, including how to turn on “do-not-track, visit https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track.

## Information We Share

We do not rent lists or sell or otherwise disclose information we collect about you, except as described
            here. We may share your information with:

- Our affiliated legal entities
- Third party service providers who perform services on our behalf based on our instructions. We do not
                authorize these service providers to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform
                services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Examples of these service providers include
                entities that process credit card payments, fulfill orders and provide web hosting, advertising and
                marketing services.

In addition, and notwithstanding any other provision herein, we may retain and disclose information about
            you (a) if we are required to do so by law or legal process; (b) to law enforcement authorities or other
            government officials; or (c) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm
            or financial loss, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal
            activity.

We also reserve the right to transfer information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or
            a portion of our business or assets, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization,
            liquidation, change in control or other sale by or of us or any affiliated entity (in each case whether in
            whole or in part). Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the
            transferee to use information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.
            Following such a sale or transfer, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your information with
            any inquiries concerning the processing of that information.

## Your Rights and Choices

We offer you certain choices in connection with the information we collect from you, such as how we use the
            information and how we communicate with you. To update your preferences, please contact us in the manner
            specified below.

            link within the marketing emails you receive from us or by contacting us as indicated below.

You have the right to request access to, or corrections of, any personal information which we hold about
            you. We will respond to all access or corrections requests promptly, and in accordance with applicable laws.
            If you would like to make an access or correction request, you should submit your request using our contact
            details in Section 19 of this Policy below.

## Children’s Privacy

Our Website is not directed to children under the age of sixteen and we do not knowingly collect information
            from children under the age of sixteen on our Website. If we become aware that we have inadvertently
            received information from a visitor under the age of sixteen on our Website, we will delete the information
            from our records.

## Storage of Information / Data Transfers

DECIEM is based in Canada and operates an international retail and online business. As a result, your
            information may be transferred to, stored at or processed in other countries, including Canada, the United
            States, Australia, Germany, France, Hong Kong and United Kingdom and other countries which may not have
            equivalent privacy or data protection laws. However, regardless of where your information is transferred, we
            will protect it in accordance with this Policy and applicable law.

## Information Security and Data Retention

We use physical, technical, organizational and administrative safeguards to help protect your information
            from unauthorized access or loss. For example, we use technology like encryption to protect sensitive
            information (such as your name and address) during transmission. However, no security system is perfect, and

            targeted advertising purposes. To not have your information shared with such parties, you may manage your

To submit a verifiable consumer request, you will be asked to provide certain information to help us verify
            your identity. The information we ask you to provide to initiate a request may differ depending upon the
            type of request, the type, sensitivity and value of the personal information that is the subject of the
            request, and the risk of harm to you that may occur as a result of unauthorized access or deletion, among
            other factors. We may also require you to provide a written declaration that you are who you say you are. If
            we cannot verify your identity, we will not be able to comply with your request. We will inform you if we
            cannot verify your identity.

### Third Party Collection

California law also requires website and online service operators to disclose whether third parties may
            collect information about their users’ online activities over time and across different sites when the users
            use the operator’s website or service. Third parties that have content or services on our Website such as a
