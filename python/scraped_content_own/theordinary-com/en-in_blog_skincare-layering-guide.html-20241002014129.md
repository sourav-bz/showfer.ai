# Your Guide to Layering
The Ordinary Skincare.

# Introduction to Skincare Layering

Navigating the world of skincare can feel overwhelming, especially for beginners. With countless products and advice available, knowing where to start—and how to layer effectively—can be daunting. Many from our community have expressed that they are unsure of the right order or combinations for their specific skin concerns. They’ve asked for more education when it comes to layering The Ordinary products.

In this blog, we will share how to layer The Ordinary products and provide clear, step-by-step guidance to help you build an effective regimen tailored to your needs. We'll also answer some of the most commonly asked questions about layering to ensure you feel confident in your skincare journey.

For those new to skincare or The Ordinary, we’ve included beginner-friendly regimens that are easy to follow and designed to deliver noticeable results.

![Skincare Layering](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAAXNSR0IB2cksfwAAAAlwSFlzAAALEwAACxMBAJqcGAAAAANQTFRF+Pj4c64OKQAAAApJREFUeJxjYAAAAAIAAUivpHEAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)

# Understanding Your Skin Type

![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAAXNSR0IB2cksfwAAAAlwSFlzAAALEwAACxMBAJqcGAAAAANQTFRF+Pj4c64OKQAAAApJREFUeJxjYAAAAAIAAUivpHEAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)

Before diving into the specifics of a skincare regimen, it’s crucial to understand your skin type. Each skin type requires different care to maintain a healthy-looking appearance. Here’s a breakdown of the most common skin types:

- Dry Skin:

A common sign of skin dehydration is a tight, uncomfortable feeling with dry, flaky skin. It can also show up as uneven texture or as skin having a dull appearance. Dry skin requires a regimen for either hydration or moisturization, depending on the needs of your skin.
- Oily Skin:

Characterized by excess sebum production, oily skin often looks shiny and is prone to acne. It benefits from lightweight, non-comedogenic products that help control oil without stripping moisture.
- Combination Skin:

This type has both oily and dry areas, typically an oily T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) and dry cheeks. Combination skin requires a balanced approach, targeting different areas with specific support.
- Sensitive Skin:

Commonly associated with signs of irritation, including redness and dry, flaky skin. It needs gentle, soothing products that minimize the potential of irritation.
- Balanced Skin (or “Normal Skin”):

There is no such thing as “normal skin” as all skin is normal. What this typically means is that skin in this case is neither too oily nor too dry. Balanced skin maintains a stable state but still benefits from a regimen that supports its natural barrier.

# Skincare Regimens vs. Layering

![The Ordinary moisturizer swatch](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAAXNSR0IB2cksfwAAAAlwSFlzAAALEwAACxMBAJqcGAAAAANQTFRF+Pj4c64OKQAAAApJREFUeJxjYAAAAAIAAUivpHEAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)

When it comes to determining your skincare application approach, The Ordinary recommends a straightforward  3-step regimen: Prep, Treat, Seal. However, your regimen may include more than just three products, as you might have multiple concerns to address. In such cases, layering multiple products within the same step (Treat) can help you achieve optimal support.

As a general rule of thumb, apply thinnest to thickest formulations, however a better way of applying products is by format. To help you a bit further, below is a breakdown of product formulation types. At The Ordinary, we classify our products based on their texture and format. This classification not only helps in determining the order of application but also in understanding how each product penetrates the skin. Think of it as the core part of our layering guide, and an essential part of understanding order of application.

1. Water-based:

These lightweight formulations are usually applied first. They are quickly absorbed and serve as a base for subsequent layers.
2. Anhydrous:

These are water-free formulations that can have an oil-like texture and  are generally applied after water-based products but before oils and creams.
3. Oils:

Oils are usually thicker and should be applied after water-based and anhydrous products to lock in moisture and actives.
4. Creams:

Often include moisturizing ingredients thicker in feel, they are applied last to seal all the previous layers and ensure maximum hydration.
5. Suspensions:

Unlike solutions, where ingredients are fully dissolved, suspensions contain particles that are evenly distributed but not dissolved. This allows for a more uniform delivery of ingredients that may not dissolve well in water or oil.
6. Emulsions:

Typically containing two ingredients that don’t mix well together, like oil and water, emulsions are designed to combine the benefits of both water-based and oil-based ingredients. Emulsions can be tricky as we have both serum and cream-based products.

Serum emulsions

like

[Retinal 0.2% Emulsion](https://theordinary.com/en-in/retinal-02-emulsion-100646.html)

would be applied after water-based serums and

cream emulsions

like

[Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA](https://theordinary.com/en-in/natural-moisturizing-factors-ha-moisturizer-100435.html)

would be applied towards the end of your skincare regimen.

We recommend using no more than three serum formulations in a single regimen for optimal layering and ingredient delivery. As a summary, we suggest applying water-based solutions first, followed by anhydrous or oil formulations, and finally cream or suspension formulations.

If you’re using more than one water-based serum, you can apply them based on the priority of your skin concerns, that is the product that targets your most primary concern. the skin.

To learn more about which ingredients to use, check out our custom regimen builder which offers recommendations tailored to your skin’s unique needs.

# Commonly Asked Questions

Below are answers to some of the most common questions about layering The Ordinary products, linked to primary skin concerns and types.

Can I use Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide together?      Yes, you can. Our Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 hydrates the skin, while Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% can help with pore appearance and uneven tone. Since both serums are water-based, they can be applied in either order, however, we recommend addressing your primary concern first and then apply the other.

Can I use Hyaluronic Acid with Retinoids?      Yes. HA provides hydration, which can counteract the potential drying effects of retinoids. Since Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 is a water-based serum, it would be applied first and then after, you would apply retinoids, such as Retinol 1% in Squalane, as it’s an anhydrous formulation.

Can I use Retinoids and Vitamin C together?      We generally recommend using retinoids and Vitamin C at different times to optimise your regimen. As an example, use Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% (Vitamin C serum) in the morning and a retoind such as Retinal 0.2% Emulsion in the evening. For more on retinoid use, visit our Comprehensive Guide to Using Retinoids.

How much product should I use for each application?      This is really dependent on the product itself. We always recommend following product directions. However, for strong actives like retinoids or direct acids, you may wish to start with 2-3x week application and gradually increase frequency as tolerated. Please note for Retinal 0.2% Emulsion, we recommend using a maximum of 2-3 times a week.

What time of day should I use The Ordinary products?      Again, this depends on the product. As an example, apply products containing Vitamin C in the morning and retinoid-based products at night. Hydrators like hyaluronic acid can be used in both AM and PM. We recommend using each product’s usage details for more information.

How long should I wait between applying products?      There is no specific wait time between products, however we recommend allowing each product to fully absorb before applying the next.

# Some Recommendations

![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAAXNSR0IB2cksfwAAAAlwSFlzAAALEwAACxMBAJqcGAAAAANQTFRF+Pj4c64OKQAAAApJREFUeJxjYAAAAAIAAUivpHEAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)

Here are some ingredient pairings we recommend using together for your regimen, during your Treat step:

For brighter-looking skin, pair Retinoids and Niacinamide.      We recommend: Retinal 0.2% Emulsion + Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%

For even-looking skin, pair Vitamin C derivatives with Glycolic Acid.      We recommend: Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner + Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%

For smoother-looking skin, pair Retinaldehyde and Hyaluronic Acid.      We recommend: Retinal 0.2% Emulsion + Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5

For clearer-looking skin, pair Salicylic Acid and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG).      We recommend: Salicylic Acid 2% Solution + Aloe 2% + NAG 2% Solution

For hydrated skin, pair Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide.      We recommend: Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 + Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%
