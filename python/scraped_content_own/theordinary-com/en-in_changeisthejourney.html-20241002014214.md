# Belonging is the Destination, Change is the Journey

[](/)

## Fellow Humans;

### Belonging is the Destination, Change is the Journey

Three years ago we published an open letter titled Nothing Changes if Nothing Changes, outlining
            our commitment to fighting racial and social injustice. While DECIEM has always been committed to creating
            an equitable world of good, we viewed this initiative as a top priority after gaining a new perspective on
            the systemic injustices that exist. The realization of these inequities has inspired us to take action and
            make a positive impact. In 2021, we shared an update on our progress in, Something Changes if Something
                Changes.

Last year, we spoke about how we had taken an honest look at where we could continue to improve through
            listening to our colleagues and communities with Commit to Change,
                Change Will Come. Now, we'd like to present the fourth chapter in our journey, Belonging is the
            Destination, Change is the Journey. This letter reflects our collective effort in creating a world where
            every person feels a sense of belonging. It is our hope that this work will help foster a more inclusive and
            kind world for all.

![Looking Forward](https://theordinary.com/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-DeciemSharedLibrary/default/dw05cf87a2/deciem/belonging-person-divider.png)

## LEARNINGS, REFLECTIONS AND
            LOOKING FORWARD

DECIEM has undergone a transformation this year. While remaining committed to prioritizing Diversity,
            Equity, and Inclusion, we realized that our framework was missing a crucial piece - Belonging. Our Belonging
            Strategy is our roadmap to creating equitable and inclusive spaces for our teams and the communities we
            touch. Our goal: Inclusive communities where all feel accepted, appreciated, and valued for who they are; a
            world where all humans can live. We hope you’ll keep reading for details on how we plan to achieve our goal.

## SAFETY TO BE OUR AUTHENTIC SELVES

Disrupt norms to foster a psychologically safe and inclusive environment where our DECIEM team members can
            show up as themselves and feel an authentic sense of belonging.

Create a safe, inclusive space where DECIEM team members can be themselves and truly belong. We believe in
            the right for every human to show up unapologetically as themselves, regardless of their background.

### UPDATE

Inclusion and belonging are at the forefront of our Engagement Survey, with the 2022 results revealing that
            Inclusion ranked as our top theme. But we're not stopping there - with our Pulse Strategy, we're committed
            to measuring belonging frequently to ensure our progress continues to soar.

![DECIEM's Inclusion and Belonging survey results](https://theordinary.com/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-DeciemSharedLibrary/default/dw4d65bfe4/deciem/belonging-inclusion-chart.png)

We're committed to ongoing diversity training and education, including emotional intelligence and bias
            training for leadership through our Human Leadership program. Our 12-month program covered essential topics
            such as; self-awareness, inclusive conversations, and supporting mental health. Our CEO, Global General
            Manager and VP of People also held listening sessions with non-leadership team members to foster direct
            communication and understanding of diverse experiences within DECIEM.

### Supporting Wellbeing:

We prioritize the well-being of our team through HUGS, our EAP program available to all team members and
            their families. We offer self-care activities and encourage a positive work culture that values work-life
            balance, communication, collaboration, and recognition of employee contributions. Our flexible programs
            include baby steps; bereavement, working from anywhere for four weeks, hybrid return to work, and personal
            days that can be used for anything from appointments, to self-care, to mental health days. We value
            well-being as much as our business goals - that's why we've integrated wellness and personal goals into our
            Human Enablement Program, Human Journeys.

![Wellbeing](https://theordinary.com/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-DeciemSharedLibrary/default/dw7c3b6d76/deciem/belonging-green-divider.png)

## LEVERAGE DIVERSITY AS OUR STRENGTH

Expect all career levels to be reflective of our communities and ensure all DECIEM team members can
                succeed

To ensure we remain focused on our commitments, we want to remind you of the goals we shared last year:

- Maintain

a workforce of at least 50% BIPOC team members, focusing on Black and Indigenous peoples
                ✓
- Increase

leadership representation to at least 50% BIPOC, focusing on Black and Indigenous
                peoples ✓

### UPDATE

BIPOC leadership at DECIEM is at 55%, up from 39% in 2021. We're committed to inclusive hiring practices to
            better reflect our communities, and in the spirit of transparency, here's a breakdown of how our leadership
            team identifies:

![DECIEM's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Stats](https://theordinary.com/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-DeciemSharedLibrary/default/dw7c907c7c/deciem/belonging-deciem-diversity-chart.png)

### UPDATE

1: Inclusive hiring practices that reduce bias and remove inequities

Black Professionals in Tech Network (Obsidi): DECIEM continues to commit to change, by fighting
            racial and social injustice. We have partnered with BPTN as one of the ways to align our recruitment
            strategy with our business values and help us maintain our goal of a global workforce of at least 50% BIPOC
            team members, focusing on Black and Indigenous Peoples, and increasing representation in leadership roles.

CCAB & PAR: We just submitted our Phase I Certification Application for the Progressive Aboriginal
            Relations (PAR) Program with the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business. And that's not all!

- Our senior leaders (Vice President and above) completed 4 Seasons of Reconciliation education and
                committed to advancing reconciliation in Canada
- We've launched an Indigenous Relations Commitment Statement to foster inclusion and support Indigenous
                Peoples and communities across Canada and beyond
- And we're working on meaningful engagements with Indigenous communities, committing to learning,
                listening, and amplifying Indigenous voices.

![Community](https://theordinary.com/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-DeciemSharedLibrary/default/dwd9245801/deciem/belonging-landscape-divider.png)

## ADDRESS SYSTEMIC BARRIERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES

Connect with consumers and suppliers to understand needs, remove barriers, and amplify changes in
                society

We want to introduce you to what we have deemed ‘humanhood’. Humanhood embraces what makes us all our most
            beautiful - being human. It recognizes our interdependent relationship with the Earth, and our shared
            journey towards creating a kinder, more conscious future for all living beings.

1. Play an active role in driving societal change and ending the cycle of inequities

### UPDATE

We're proud to share that during our 2023 fiscal year (starting July 2022), we've donated approximately $1M
            (CAD) to global organizations committed to fostering belonging and creating a world of good.

## ACCOUNTABILITY AND GOVERNANCE

Ensure internal leadership accountability and be transparent about our progress as a company

1: Drive leadership accountability in DEI

### UPDATE

- Belonging is our North Star:

the guiding force behind our culture of authenticity, inclusion, and
                innovation. By prioritizing this metric, we can ensure a psychologically safe and engaging environment
                that supports the well-being of every team member. At DECIEM, fostering a sense of belonging isn't just
                the right thing to do, it's our imperative.
- Belonging, Sustainability, & Social Impact Goal:

We are taking our leadership accountability to a
                new level of responsibility by incorporating elements of doing good, belonging, and cost consciousness,
                making it more holistic and robust. Our aim is to achieve a sense of belonging and make a positive
                social and sustainable impact in all our activities. Starting from 2024, Senior Managers and above will
                have goals tied to Belonging, which will affect their personal compensation. This represents a shift in
                the way we define success to include Belonging, Sustainability, and Social Impact.

2: Report on DEI progress internally and externally

### UPDATE

We're sharing our annual DEI progress update publicly – you're reading it right now ;-).

Thanks for reading our commitments and updates. We're committed to continuous improvement and adapting to
            the evolving world. There's still much to learn and unlearn, but with focus and dedication, we'll achieve
            impactful and sustainable change. We look forward to sharing our ongoing progress with you.

With gratitude, love, and a deep sense of hope for our future.

Nicola
Co-Founder
