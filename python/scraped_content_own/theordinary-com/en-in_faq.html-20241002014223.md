## Contact

### How can I get in touch with Customer Happiness?

Our Customer Happiness team is based out of our Toronto, Canada head office with partial support available through our offices in Nottingham, UK and Melbourne, Australia. The team’s hours of service are Monday to Friday from 9:30 AM to 5 PM EST (excluding holidays). We have limited support available on the weekends.

To reach our team, please visit our contact page to submit your inquiry or give us a call.

### When can I expect a response to my email?

Our team is working very hard but we are experiencing very rapid growth at this time. While we are expanding our resources, our aim is to respond to all inquiries within 48 hours. Please note that our response times may vary during peak periods such as after product launches or promotions.

### Can I place an order over the phone?

For better security, we are unable to process any orders and/or accept payments over the phone. Our Customer Happiness team will gladly walk you through the process if you need any help placing your order online. To reach our team, please visit our contact page to submit your inquiry or give us a call.

## Products + Regimens

### Do you test on animals? Are your products cruelty-free?

DECIEM does not test on animals and does not ask others to do so. DECIEM has been certified with the Leaping Bunny stamp of approval, a widely recognized standard for personal care and household products.

### Are your products vegan?

The Ordinary, The Chemistry Brand, and HIF have been certified vegan by PETA, and we are currently obtaining certification for all other DECIEM brands. Until then, please refer to our legend for each product on our website that will indicate the specifications of any given product (for example, if it is vegan, nut-free, oil-free, etc.)

### The product I want is out of stock!

We know there’s nothing worse than waiting! We recommend signing up for our email notifications for products that are out of stock. If you click the “Email Me When in Stock” button underneath the product you’re interested in, we’ll let you know as soon as it’s restocked!

Kindly note that these notifications may be unavailable during promotional periods. However, please check back regularly as we will be restocking on an on-going basis as normal. Please also note that our team is not able to provide restock estimates for products that are unavailable. We apologize for any inconvenience!

### Can you recommend some products for my skin type?

Absolutely! For regimen/product related inquiries, please fill out the contact form on our website and our Customer Happiness team will be happy to further assist!

### Can you send me samples?

Unfortunately, we do not offer product samples at this time! We encourage you to visit one of our DECIEM brick-and-mortar stores to test our products in person.

### Where can I buy your products?

You can purchase your products online at deciem.com or in one of our brick and mortar stores.

You can also check if there are any stockists nearby, however please note that third party purchases are excluded from our return policy!

### How do I store your products?

We recommend storing our products in a cool dry place away from direct sunlight. Some products such as The Ordinary Granactive Retinoids/Retinols do require refrigeration after opening, but this is noted on the directions.

For all others we suggest storing at room temperature, however, there is no harm in refrigerating (with few exceptions).

### What is the expiry date of your products?

A few products such as NIOD CAIL 1% and our sun protection products will have an expiry date noted on the packaging.

For all others, the shelf life is three years when unopened and stored at room temperature. This is the regulatory threshold for testing. Upon opening, please refer to the period-after-opening (PAO) symbol to identify the lifetime of the product.

### Can you tell me which products are suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding people?

While each ingredient has been tested and is considered safe for topical application, DECIEM products have not been tested on pregnant or breastfeeding people. When pregnant or breastfeeding, it is recommended to avoid any skincare products containing retinoids such as formulations with Granactive Retinoid or Retinol.

### How do I conduct an at-home patch test?

Patch tests are an easy way to help predict if you will have a negative initial reaction to a new product. It is recommended to perform a patch test before incorporating a new product into your routine. We have outlined a general method for conducting your own patch test based on the type of product. Please refer to our Patch Testing Guide for an in-depth guide to patch testing.

### Is my product authentic or counterfeit?

The safety of our customers is a key priority, which is why we are committed to the prevention of the sale and distribution of counterfeit products or products sold through unauthorized retail channels.

Unfortunately, we are unable to verify the authenticity or integrity of any products or packaging that have not been purchased directly from DECIEM or one of our authorized retailers. For your safety and to achieve the intended benefits of our products and technologies, we strongly recommend only purchasing from authorized retailers or us directly. Our authorized network of retailers can be explored on our Find Us page.

## Order Inquiries

If you have placed the order without setting up a password you can track it here.
If you have an account with a password you can view your order history here.

### Can I cancel my order?

We kindly ask that you review your order carefully before placing it to ensure that all information and the contents of your order are correct. Please be advised that once an order is placed, it cannot be modified.

Cancellations must be requested within 1 hour of the order being placed and within our service hours (Monday-Friday, 9:30 AM-5 PM EST/GMT). While we cannot guarantee cancellations, we will try our best to accommodate where possible. Please note, we have very limited support on weekends and public/bank holidays.

### Can I remove products from my order?

Unfortunately, once an order has been placed, we cannot make any edits or substitutions.

### Can I change my shipping address on an order that’s been placed?

We are unable to update or amend shipping addresses once an order has been placed. If there is an error in your shipping address, we kindly recommend requesting a cancellation and placing a new order with the correct shipping address.

### How many products can I order at a time?

As we want to be fair to all of our customers, many factors are taken in when we review an order including which warehouse is fulfilling the order, shipping fees, frequency of orders, and the individual number of units contained within that order. To read more about our limits, please review our Terms and Conditions.

### I placed an order on your website and never received a confirmation email.

Order confirmations are sent out immediately. Our emails may be accidentally flagged by spam filters. Please check the spam folder of your email and mark us as nice instead of spam.

If you haven’t received confirmation from us, please fill out the contact page and we will be happy to assist further. If you don’t know your order number, please confirm the email address and the full name provided when placing the order so that we can look into it for you!

### How can I track my order?

Once your order has been dispatched from our warehouse, we will send you an email with your online tracking information. Use this information to track your order via the courier website linked in the email.

If you have a DECIEM account, you can view your order status using your order number and your email address here once your order has been shipped.

### I did not receive a tracking number!

We assign tracking numbers to parcels right before they are shipped. As soon as your parcel is sent out, we send you a tracking notification with your tracking number for each order along with a link so you know where you can track the order. Please check if such an email is sent into your spam folder.

### There’s an item missing/damaged! My order is wrong.

Oh no! We’re so sorry about this. We do our best to make sure orders are packaged correctly but sometimes people make mistakes. Please fill our contact form with your order number, photo of all the products received, and a photo of the packing slip with any initials marked clearly visible.

Any damaged or incorrect orders should be brought to our attention within 14 days of receipt. We may request additional photos of the damaged items so please do not throw them away until you have connected with our team or we will not be able to further assist.

### My order has been shipped to the wrong address!

Unfortunately, we are unable to modify the route of a parcel once it has been shipped and we are unable to assist further if it is delivered as addressed.

However, if you see that your parcel is being returned back to DECIEM, simply reach out to us through our contact page and let us know! We can reship your order a second time, to the same address originally input at checkout, at no additional cost. However, if you wish to change the destination, kindly note, your order will be refunded and you must place the order again with the updated shipping address.

If your parcel is returned and we have not heard from you, the DECIEM team will begin the refund process once the parcel has been received back at our warehouse.

### Why is my order in Belgium?

Some international orders may be shipped via courier Landmark Global and are sent to their distribution centre in Belgium before being sent to their individual destination countries.

Once an order arrives at its destined country, it is transferred to the local post service for delivery.

### I’m having issues tracking my order; can you help me?

Once an order has left our facility, please note that it can take a few business days for some shipping couriers to update further tracking details on their website.

If your tracking number does not work, or hasn’t updated within 5 business days, please reach out to us through our contact page and our Customer Happiness team will get right on that for you!

### My order is stuck with customs!

When travelling across borders, your order may be held up at customs. Sadly, we do not have any control over this, we are all at the mercy of your country’s customs officials. Please be aware that there is always the potential for international orders to get caught up in the system, and your package may be delayed up to 7 weeks. This is not a common occurrence, but it can happen. Once we’ve shipped your package, we cannot do anything once it is in possession of customs officials and your country’s postal service.

### My package is being Returned to Sender (RTS) - What can I do?

If you see that your parcel is being returned back to DECIEM, simply reach out to us through our contact form and let us know! We can reship your order a second time at no additional cost. If your parcel is returned and we have not heard from you, the DECIEM team will begin the refund process once the parcel has been received back at our warehouse.

### My order is missing/stolen!

Have you checked your tracking information? Please make sure to check your surrounding area and with your neighbours. If you’re unable to locate your parcel, please contact us so that we can start an investigation with the courier in regards to your missing parcel. Depending on the courier, investigations can take up to 10 business days to conclude.

Please note that any domestic orders reported missing or stolen must be disputed within 14 days from shipment date. International orders reported missing/stolen must be reported within 21 days from shipment date. Any requests made outside of this timeframe have no guaranteed resolution.

Until a missing package has been returned to DECIEM or officially declared lost, we are unable to reship or refund the order.

We assess each report on a case by case basis. If the parcel is confirmed delivered with a Proof of Delivery (POD) or if a "Safe Place/Leave with Neighbour/Delivered with Consignees Authority" request is made with our courier directly, we are unable to issue a refund if these parcels are lost/stolen.

Most orders within the EU are shipped, with duties paid, from our third-party distribution centre in Poland. Certain European countries that are not part of the European Union (EU) may incur additional fees (i.e. brokerage, taxes/duties or customs fees) which will be the customer's responsibility. Some of these countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, Switzerland, Georgia, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Monaco, Moldova, Montenegro, Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Russia, San Marino, and Ukraine. Rest assured, our goal is to offer the most convenient shipping experience possible and we are continuously striving to improve our service. Should you require any further clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to us!

### Has Brexit delayed UK or EU shipments?

We'd like to assure you that there is minimal impact on your shopping experience post-Brexit and we welcome you to shop as normal. The majority of orders destined for the EU are processed and shipped within the EU, ensuring an optimal delivery time.

### Do you ship with Signature Required?

Orders within the USA over $500 are shipped with a signature required. Some international parcels may also require a signature upon delivery.

### I'm in the US. Can I ship to military addresses or P.O. boxes?

We're so sorry but we are unable to ship our products to Military addresses or P.O. boxes right now. We hope to offer a solution in the near future!

### Can I ship to a mail/freight forwarding address?

At this time, DECIEM allows mail forwarding addresses. However, please ensure your first and last name are included in the appropriate fields.

Please note if you choose to use a mail forwarding service, we are no longer responsible once it is delivered to that address. Orders shipped to a mail forwarding address are not eligible for replacements or refunds if we believe it has been reasonably delivered to that address.

We are not responsible for any damages or missing items shipped to a mail forwarding address.

We do not provide SDS sheets, so please be mindful of this when using your selected service.

### Do you ship to China?

We do not ship to China at this time. If you are shopping with us from China, please visit TMall.

### Why do some items have shipping restrictions to my area? If I am able to order them, will they take longer to arrive?

We work with various couriers in different regions; shipping restrictions are mandated by international/local regulations, but couriers can also impose their own restrictions for these items. These items are restricted from air transport and must be shipped via ground shipping only. As such, they may take longer to arrive. Please reference your estimated delivery date at checkout and monitor your post-purchase notifications for estimated delivery. Please note that we are unable to offer expedited shipping.

Note: Orders containing restricted items cannot be shipped to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico. Additionally, orders containing volumes of more than 300ml cannot be shipped within Australia

## Billing + Payments

### What methods of payment do you currently accept?

We accept all major credit cards. When paying by credit card, your name and billing address must match the address on file with the card issuer. We also accept PayPal and credit card gift cards. Credit card gift cards can only be redeemed for orders less than the full amount available on the credit card gift card. We do not accept online payments from digital banking apps such as Revolut, Monzo, etc.

### When will my payment be processed?

Your card will be charged during checkout once your order has been placed.

### What currency do you charge in?

We currently offer prices in the following currencies which reflect pricing in each region. Some regions include taxes and duties while others do not. Our system takes into account these variations when checking out.Currently, our system provides pricing based on your shipping country:

Canada

CAD

USA

USD

United Kingdom

GBP

Australia

AUD

European Union

EUR

South Korea

KRW

All other countries have pricing displayed in USD but the pricing of products outside of the USA is higher in USD than within the USA because of additional costs we incur to import these products. Orders within Canada, USA, UK (and the EU) and Australia are shipped from our local offices within these regions.

If the local/credit card currency is different than the one used at the time of checkout then your bank will convert the amount using the current exchange rate. Any international bank fees are not imposed by DECIEM.

The currency and pricing of your order are determined by the country from which you visit us and cannot be changed.

### Why have you charged me more than the total?

We only charge the amount calculated during checkout and displayed on your invoice. However, if you are using a prepaid card, there may be temporary holds or fees associated with card usage. Please refer to the terms and conditions of the card you are using for further details. If you are not using a prepaid card and believe you have been overcharged, please do contact us and we'll be happy to assist you.

Once we have issued your refund, we'll send you an updated copy of your invoice that will show the refunded items.

### Why is my refund less than the amount paid?

Refunds are issued in the same currency as the order was paid. However, please note if you say using a card with a different currency, the amount you get back reflects the exchange rate on the day we issue the refund. Exchange rates change every day so the amount you get back may differ from what was paid.

### Can I mail back store purchases?

In order to receive a refund to your original method of payment, store purchases must be returned in a DECIEM store within the same country. If you are unable to do so, please contact our Customer Happiness team via our contact page for further assistance.

### Can you refund on to another card?

Your refund will still be issued to the card used on your order so long as the account is still open. When a card is lost, stolen, or cancelled we can still refund that card. We cannot refund your order onto a different card. If we issue the refund and the payment is declined, we will then issue your refund via PayPal, but the transaction must be declined first.

### I have my Return Details, where can I submit them?

Right here.

### My transaction was declined but my card was charged?!

If there were multiple attempts to pay for your order. You may see this as a pending charge or authorization hold on your billing statement, but as the transaction was not completed it will not be charged to your card. The bank often sets aside the funds in anticipation of a successful charge. However, as the transaction was declined no funds have been transferred to DECIEM.
