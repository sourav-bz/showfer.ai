## Overview

- [About](#overview-about)

### Description

Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% is a cream-like formula that brightens skin tone and visibly improves skin texture due to a high concentration of azelaic acidâ€”a natural and effective antioxidant found in grains. It has a lower irritation potential than other direct acids, which means itâ€™s gentle enough for daily use as part of your skincare regimen.

### In your regimen

- Prep
- Step 2:
