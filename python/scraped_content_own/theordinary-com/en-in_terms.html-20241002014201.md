## Terms of Sale

The following terms of sale apply to orders placed through this Site:

1. Processing:

All products offered for purchase on the Site are subject to availability. Any DECIEM publication concerning DECIEM products offered for sale may include inaccuracies or typographical errors.

DECIEM may make improvements and/or changes in the products described in these publications at any time without notice. All orders shall be subject to the terms of these Terms and Conditions. Orders may only be made by individuals who are over the age of legal majority in their jurisdiction of residence. Payment will be processed by DECIEM’s independent third-party payment processor, using the preferred payment method you designate or that is designated in your account. If you would like to use a different payment method, please visit your account settings to update your billing information. We may charge another stored payment method if your default payment card is declined or no longer available to us. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to cancel or refuse any orders for any reason at any stage of the online ordering process, including after an order has been submitted and whether or not the order has been confirmed. Unless otherwise agreed to by DECIEM, payment must be received by DECIEM prior to acceptance of an order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, DECIEM may in our sole discretion choose not to charge your credit card until your order has been shipped. DECIEM may process payment for and ship parts of an order separately. Some situations that may result in cancellation include limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our independent third-party payment processor. We will attempt to contact you if all or any portion of your order is cancelled, or if additional information is required to accept your order.
2. Pricing:

You understand that: (i) the prices for products displayed through the Site may differ from the prices offered or published by third parties for the same product and/or from prices available at third-party websites/mobile applications, and that such prices may not be the lowest prices at which the products are sold; (ii) DECIEM has no obligation to itemize its costs, profits or margins when publishing such prices; and (iii) pricing stated on the Site may be changed at any time. You will be billed for your order at the time it is placed. Taxes shall be applied to the billed amount and shall be based upon the region the order is to be delivered. You may only purchase or order products for non-commercial and lawful purposes and any other use is not permitted.
3. Returns:

If you are not satisfied with your order, simply return any portion of the order and we will be happy to process an exchange or remit your account for the full amount based on our Return Policy which can be found here:

[https://deciem.com/document/returns.](https://theordinary.com/en-in/returns.html)
4. Quantity Limits:

DECIEM limits orders to thirty (30) units of the same product and ninety (90) total products for each order. DECIEM reserves the right to impose additional limits to the quantities and products which you, your family or any group can purchase, to reject, correct, cancel or refuse orders, and to determine accounts in its discretion including, without limitation, if DECIEM believes that your conduct contravenes applicable law or is harmful to the interests of DECIEM. If you have any questions, please contact us as set forth in Section 21.
5. Delivery:

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver items as quickly as possible and within any time periods indicated in the order; however, DECIEM will not be responsible for any delays in delivery which are beyond our control. Where delivery is delayed, DECIEM will notify you as soon as possible.
6. Fraud:

In order to protect you and DECIEM from fraudulent transactions, DECIEM may provide your transaction-related information to a reputable third-party organization to perform an address verification. This address verification is intended to ensure that the "bill to" address that you provide matches your credit card address. DECIEM also reserves the right, at its discretion, not to ship items ordered or purchased on this Site to certain addresses. In the event that DECIEM chooses not to ship an item, you will be notified by email and any amount charged to you will be refunded.

## Copyright Complaints

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send DECIEM a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be removed, or access to it be blocked. The notice must include the following information:

1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;
2. Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
3. Identification of the specific material or link alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow DECIEM to locate the material on the Site;
4. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);
5. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send DECIEM a counter-notice.
				Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see https://www.copyright.gov/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent using the contact form described in Section 21.

WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT OR MATERIALS INCLUDED ON THE SITE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ARE NOT LEGALLY EXCLUDABLE.

## Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us and our affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives harmless for any loss, damages, expenses or costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any third party claim, action, or demand resulting from your use of the Site, breach of these Terms and Conditions or from our termination of your access to or use of the Site. Such termination will not affect either party’s rights or obligations, which accrued before the termination.

## Disputes

In consideration of and as a condition of your use of the Site you and DECIEM (collectively, “the parties”) agree as follows (the “Arbitration Agreement”):

Applicability; Exclusions; Court and Jury Trial Waiver

The parties agree that any and all covered disputes (as defined below) that either party has the legal right to sue for in court, whether now or in the future, shall be subject to final and binding arbitration under the arbitration provisions set forth below. This means that the parties have selected arbitration as the sole and exclusive forum for the parties to sue or be sued in for all covered disputes, regardless of when the dispute first arose or arises and irrespective of the time period(s) involved in the dispute. The term “covered disputes” means all disputes and claims between the parties, including any disputes or claims: arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions; relating to the relationship between the parties; arising under any international laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and California Consumer Privacy Act, and all other claims or disputes under municipal ordinances, executive orders, contract, tort, public policy, or common law (judge-made law). However, “covered disputes” shall exclude any disputes or claims relating to your violation or threatened violation of our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of our affiliates, partners or licensors or otherwise, in which we have a cause of action in equity. For such disputes and claims, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, and you consent to jurisdiction and venue in any such court for such purposes.

The parties intend to require arbitration of all covered disputes that can lawfully be arbitrated. It is understood by the parties that the term “covered disputes” shall cover and include all such disputes not only between the parties to these Terms and Conditions but also all disputes or claims against any of your heirs, executors, personal representatives, and assigns, and all such disputes or claims not only against DECIEM but also against any and all of its predecessors and successors and any of its collective officers, agents, employees, members, shareholders, directors, managers, and attorneys.

Usage of JAMS Streamlined or Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures; Arbitrator to Decide All Issues; Arbitrator’s Decisions Are Final and Binding

Either party shall initiate arbitration under the National Arbitration Rules of the ADR Institute of Canada, Inc. The arbitrator (and not a court) shall decide all issues in any covered dispute including, but not limited to, issues regarding the non-availability of class arbitration, timeliness, scope of arbitrator’s authority, arbitration procedures, any issues regarding arbitrability of the parties’ dispute, statute of limitations, and all other issues regarding the application, interpretation, and implementation of these Terms and Conditions. The arbitrator’s decisions shall be final and binding. The parties agree that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter a judgment upon the award made by the arbitrator or to confirm an arbitration award, and any such proceeding shall not itself be deemed a covered dispute.

Selection and Authority of Arbitrator; Full Remedies Available; Enforceability

The parties agree that an arbitrator shall be selected by the parties consistent with the applicable National Arbitration Rules of the ADR Institute of Canada, Inc. as they exist at the time of the Terms and Conditions’ execution. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitrator shall have the power and authority to award any remedy or relief available under applicable law and shall be the sole authority to interpret and apply the provisions of these Terms and Conditions. The arbitrator shall have the authority to apply any law, or executive order, or any common law that the arbitrator deems applicable to the covered dispute. If there are any ambiguities in these Terms and Conditions, it is the parties’ intent that all ambiguities be resolved in favor of arbitration. If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

Class and Collective Action Waiver; No Consolidated or Joint Actions

The parties agree that all covered disputes brought against each other will be arbitrated on an individual basis only and not in a class action arbitration, a collective action arbitration, or on any other group, representative, consolidated, or joint basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any covered dispute or any claim or issue in a covered dispute on any basis other than on an individual basis and may not proceed or direct the parties to proceed on a class or collective action basis or consolidate or join one or more covered disputes pertaining to you with any other individual’s or entity’s covered dispute(s). The provisions in this Arbitration Agreement mean that both parties waive their right to commence, become a party to, or in any way participate in any class action, collective action, or group or representative action or claim against the other party or in any such action or claim consolidated or joined with another party, with respect to any covered dispute, and each party agrees to opt-out of or be severed from any such action or proceeding.

Fees, Award

Each party shall bear the cost of his/her/its own legal fees and costs, including but not limited to attorneys’ fees and expert witness fees, subject to any right to recover such fees and costs under applicable law, which the arbitrator shall apply where applicable. In rendering an arbitration award, the arbitrator shall apply applicable and appropriate law and shall award all statutory remedies and penalties, including attorneys’ fees and costs to the extent authorized by and consistent with law. The award shall be in writing and the arbitrator shall set forth the essential findings of fact and law. Either party may request that a transcript and/or recording of the hearing be made.

## Consent to Receive Notices Electronically by Posting on the Site and Via Email

You consent to receive any agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications (collectively, "Notices") to which these Terms and Conditions refer from us electronically including without limitation by e-mail or by posting notices on this Site. You agree that all Notices that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. To withdraw your consent to receive Notices electronically, you must notify us of your withdrawal of such consent by notifying us using the contact form described in Section 21 and discontinue your use of this Site. In such event, all rights granted to you pursuant to these Terms and Conditions, including but not limited to the limited licenses set forth in Section 8 hereof, shall automatically terminate. Unfortunately, we cannot provide the benefits of this Site to any user that cannot consent to receipt of Notices electronically.
				Please note that this consent to receive Notices is entirely separate from any election you may make with respect to receipt of marketing communications. Your options with respect to receipt of marketing communications are set forth in our Privacy Policy.

## General

You acknowledge and agree that these Terms and Conditions constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between us concerning your use of the Site, and supersede and govern all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications.
				With respect to any dispute regarding the Site, all rights and obligations and all actions contemplated by these Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of Toronto, Canada, as if the Terms and Conditions were a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within Toronto.
				The Effective Date of these Terms and Conditions is set forth at the top of this webpage. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms and Conditions at any time by posting the changes on the Site. We encourage you to return to this webpage frequently so that you are aware of our current Terms and Conditions. Any changes are effective immediately upon posting to the Site. Your continued use of the Site thereafter constitutes your agreement to all such changed Terms and Conditions. 
				Nothing contained in these Terms and Conditions shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between us. Our failure to require your performance of any provision hereof shall not affect our full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall our waiver of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. In the event that any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by any applicable arbitral award, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms and Conditions unenforceable or invalid as a whole but these Terms and Conditions shall be modified, to the extent possible, by the adjudicating entity to most fully reflect the original intent of the parties as reflected in the original provision.
