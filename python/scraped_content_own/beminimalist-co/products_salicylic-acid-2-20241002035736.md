## FAQs

Is salicylic acid good for acne treatment?

Yes. Not only does it reduce active acne, but Salicylic acid also boosts natural cell turnover and unclogs pores, thus preventing future breakouts and blackheads. It helps in balancing your oil by controlling sebum activity and reducing acne marks and dark spots. Also, research shows that Salicylic Acid has anti-inflammatory properties, making it an ideal solution for relieving inflammation.

Can salicylic acid serum cause purging or breakouts?

Any active ingredient that promotes cell turnover can cause purging in certain people, especially with sensitive or acne-prone skin. It is an entirely natural and normal response to active ingredients. Salicylic acid pushes trapped sebum and oil to the surface, and thus those acnes which were supposed to appear later pop up early. The natural cell-shedding cycle in a healthy young person is 28 days. So, purging usually subsides in 3-4 weeks. It is important to stick with a product during the purging phase. You cannot avoid purging, but there are things you can do to ease it out. The first and most important thing is to take it slow. If you are new to acids, apply 2-3 times a week, and gradually increase your frequency. Avoid prolonged sun exposure and do not touch or pop your acne.

What is the recommended age for using the salicylic acid serum?

Scientifically, it is safe for a younger age, but to avoid overconsumption and any undesirable effects, we recommend it for teens and adults (Above 18 years). People below 18 years should consult their doctor before including this in their routine.

Since more research is needed on the impact of topical SA on the features of babies, pregnant, and breastfeeding, women should consult their doctor before including SA in their routine. People with specific skin conditions or health issues shall also consult their doctor before using any direct acid.
