Broad Spectrum SPF 50, PA++++

A light weight, moisturiser-meets-sunscreen. This broad spectrum SPF 50 with PA++++ rating, has a very light texture that spreads easily & disappears leaving behind a natural, moisturised, non-shiny look. Loaded with Vitamins A, B, E & F that help repair skin and minimise damage caused by UV exposure.
