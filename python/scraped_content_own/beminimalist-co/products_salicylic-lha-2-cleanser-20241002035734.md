What Makes It Potent?

- Contains Salicylic Acid (BHA) that penetrates deep into the skin & scoops out the dirt, debris, and sebum, hence reducing the oily look of the skin
- Formulated with Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (LHA), which unlike Salicylic Acid, stays on outer layer of skin and provides gentle exfoliation, revealing soft skin. The combination provides multi-level cleansing
- Boosted with anti-bacterial Zinc and several hydrating & soothing ingredients like Xylitylglucoside, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Allantoin, Pentyle Glycol for hydrating overall after-feel
- Formulated with 2 very mild sulfate-free surfactants (cleansers) that provide optimum cleaning without stripping skin lipids or proteins

All our ingredients are sourced from leading global supplier. Our Salicylic Acid comes from Merck, Germany and is a high purity grade ingredient

Ideal For

Skin type: Oily/Combination, Acne-Prone

Concerns: Acne, Breakouts & Oiliness

Suitable for: 15+ years of age

## Ingredients

Salicylic Acid (BHA)

Salicylic Acid is a relatively smaller molecule with molecular weight of 138 g/mol, and about 58% of Salicylic Acid is able to penetrate our outermost skin layer (Stratum Corneum). This results in deeper cleaning, exfoliation and anti-acne benefits

Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (LHA)

Capryloyl Salicylic Acid (LHA) is a larger molecule with molecular weight of 264 g/mol, making it almost double the size of Salicylic Acid. Because of this, only 6% of LHA penetrates past Stratum Corneum, making it excellent for superficial skin exfoliation

Zinc

It normalizes sebum production and because of its anti-bacterial properties, Zinc limits the proliferation of acne-causing bacteria

All Ingredients

Aqua, Glycerin, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Propanediol, Sodium Lauroyl Methyl Isethionate, Xylitylglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, PEG-150 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Salicylic Acid, Betaine, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Panthenol, Allantoin, Zinc PCA, Sodium PCA, Coco-Glucoside, Glyceryl Oleate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate, Lactic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Hydroxide
