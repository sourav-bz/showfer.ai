## FAQs

Is it suitable for oily / combination skin?

Yes. While this moisturizer can be used for all skin types as it contains all the necessary components of a moisturizer, it's more suited for oily / combination skin because of the lower concentration of emollients and occlusives. It can be used by all skin types throughout the year and during very dry seasons for dry skin as well as when light moisturization is desired.

Can this be used along with acne treatments like tretinoin?

Yes. Vitamin B5 has skin-repairing and soothing properties and it does not have any conflict with Vitamin A, so it can easily be layered on tretinoin creams.

What is the recommended age for using this moisturizer?

This is an everyday moisturizer with skin repairing and soothing properties. Anyone over the age of 15 can use this moisturizer.
