## Ingredients

Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate & Uvinul A Plus

These ingredients serve as UV filters for hair care, protecting the hair strands from the damaging effects of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. By absorbing harmful UV rays, they help prevent color fade in hair and reduce the risk of damage, such as dryness, brittleness, and breakage, caused by sun exposure.

Ceramide NG

Ceramides are lipid molecules found naturally in the hair's cuticle. Ceramide NG mimics these natural lipids, reinforcing the hair's natural barrier. By doing so, it helps lock in moisture, keeping the hair hydrated and less prone to dryness and frizziness.

Isostearoyl Hydrolyzed Keratin

Keratin is the protein that hair is primarily made of. Isostearoyl hydrolyzed keratin is a smaller, broken-down form of this protein, which allows it to penetrate deep into the hair's cortex. Once inside, it repairs and strengthens the hair from within, targeting damaged and weakened areas.

Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil (Argan Oil)

Extracted from the kernels of the Argan tree, this oil is highly valued for its nutritive properties. It is rich in antioxidants, essential fatty acids (like linoleic acid and oleic acid), and vitamins, which provide deep nourishment to the hair follicles. These components help in moisturising the hair, reducing frizziness, and restoring a healthy shine to dull, lifeless hair.

All Ingredients

Cyclopentasiloxane, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isododecane, Caprylyl Methicone, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Dimethicone, Phenyl Trimethicone, Bis-Hydroxy/Methoxy Amodimethicone, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethiconol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Isostearoyl Hydrolyzed Keratin, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ceramide NG, Isononyl Isononanoate, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Sunflower Oil, Beta-Carotene
