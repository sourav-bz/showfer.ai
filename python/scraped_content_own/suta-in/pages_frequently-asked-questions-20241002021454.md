SAREE WITH FALL FAQs

What is ‘fall’?

Will fall be attached to the complete saree?

No, It starts from the initial drape of the saree continuing till the pleats, Leaving the blouse piece.

What is the material of fall used on our sarees?

The fall fabric is picked according to the fabric and the weight of the saree. The fabric is either Mul cotton or cotton.

How do you sew falls?

Falls are sewn by hand to the sarees.

Can the saree be customized without fall?

Yes, you can get in touch with us on info@suta.in and we would be able to help you out

What is the estimated delivery time?

The delivery time varies from cities to cities. Typically it takes 3-4 days for all metros & Tier 1 cities. Tier 2 & 3 cities may take 3 to 5 days. Some cities in North East India & J&K etc. may take minimum 5 to a maximum of 7 days. Due to unforeseen reasons there might be delay in shipments and would appreciate your patience.

Furthermore, we would also share the estimate delivery dates via SMS and email.

Why did I receive only a part of my order?

The reasons why you would have partially received the order are: We might have shipped your items in two different shipments. The other would still be in transit. OR The stock for the remaining items was not available. In this case, you will receive a call from our customer care informing you the same. Only after your confirmation, the order will be shipped to you. In the unlikely situation that you are not available on your mentioned phone number, an email will be sent to you informing the same. You could call our customer care to get more clarity on your order status.

Unfortunately, that is not possible at the moment. Since the system would have already passed the mobile number and address to our warehouse to pack and ship your product. You can email us at info@suta.in to inform about such a situation. We will try our best to get the same resolved if the order is not shipped. In case the package is returned to us after attempted delivery or because of a wrong shipping address provided by the customer at the time of placing an order, we will be able to offer a partial refund after deduction of Rs 150 for shipping.
