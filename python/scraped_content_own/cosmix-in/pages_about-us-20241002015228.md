## HOW IT ALL STARTED

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0281/7507/3373/files/howitstart.png?v=1724736136)

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0281/7507/3373/files/all2x.png?v=1724933447)

There was a problem in the wellness industry.

Hello there! My name is Vibha and I’m a herbalist. In 2016 I was diagnosed with PCOS and I tried everything to “fix” myself and fast. When I turned to the wellness industry for solutions all I got was a miracle serum that promised to fix my acne overnight or a specialist that told me to just lose some weight.

Tired of the insecurity marketing that came along with the instant fixes and band aid solutions, I turned to herbalism and ancient ayurveda that looked deeper than just the symptoms.

After experiencing the power of adaptogens and herbs, I knew I had to share it with everyone. So along with my husband, Soorya, we set out to revolunatize the modern day wellness industry!

### How we’re solving the problem

## Address the root-cause,  not just the symptoms.

When we get acne, we often reach for a new serum or drink more water, hoping for a quick fix. But the truth is, our skin reflects our internal health. Often, the root cause lies deeper, in your liver, gut, or hormones. That's why our formulations are designed with this holistic approach in mind. Explore the feature below to see how interconnected our health truly is!

### tap on a  health concern

HORMONAL

IMBALANCE

HAIR FALL

ACNE

BLOATING

SLEEP

STRESS

LIVER

During times of stress, your body prioritises making cortisol (the stress hormone
                                    that keeps you alert) over sex hormones because its main concern is your immediate
                                    safety. This delay in producing sex hormones becomes more pronounced during
                                    prolonged high-stress situations, ultimately leading to hormonal imbalances.

The liver is responsible for breaking down estrogen and flushing out any excess that
                                    is present in our body. When the liver is overworked, this metabolization process
                                    gets delayed leading to estrogen dominance in the body which can cause increased PMS
                                    symptoms and irregular periods.

Nutrition

Poor  Circulation

Stress

Nutrition significantly influences hair health, and inadequate intake can contribute
                                    to hair fall. Protein is particularly vital for hair growth since our hair follicles
                                    are predominantly made up of it.

According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), hair health is closely linked to the
                                    state of blood circulation in the body, in a way you can consider hair as an
                                    extension of blood. Proper circulation is considered to nourish the body’s tissues,
                                    in order to “feed the hair follicles” and thus lead to stronger and healthier hair
                                    from within.

Elevated cortisol levels due to stress can prematurely push a lot of the hair
                                    follicles out of the growth (anagen) phase and into the resting (telogen) phase of
                                    the hair cycle causing shedding.

Liver

Gut

Stress

Hormones

Our skin and liver are connected through the liver-skin axis. An overworked liver
                                    struggles to perform its daily task of flushing toxins. Since the skin is the
                                    largest excretory organ, when the liver fails to function properly, toxins
                                    accumulate and can manifest on the skin.

What we eat can directly influence our skin. If you notice that you normally get a
                                    breakout when you eat a particular food or eat food that is not home cooked, it
                                    could be a sign that your gut needs more nourishment.

Stress (physical or emotional) can elevate cortisol levels that put our sebaceous
                                    glands in overdrive, leading to clogged pores and increased acne breakouts.

If you notice breakouts around your period, or just before around your jawline, there
                                    might be a sign that your hormones are imbalanced. Fluctuations or imbalances in
                                    androgen levels stimulate sebum production, alter skin cell turnover, and promote
                                    inflammation, all of which contribute to acne.

Imbalance in the gut microbiota

Food Intolerances

Certain bacteria in our gut play a crucial role in breaking down fiber. When there's
                                    an imbalance in the microbiome, these fiber-breaking bacteria may decrease in
                                    number. As a result, undigested fiber ferments and produces gas, which can lead to
                                    bloating.

Food intolerances & sensitivities can cause bloating as many times the body may lack
                                    certain enzymes to break down the enzymes present in those foods.

Stress

Blood Sugar Management

Gut

Stress, one of the most common causes, puts our body in a 'fight or flight' mode.
                                    When our body is in this high-alert state, we cannot prioritize deep sleep, causing
                                    issues in our sleep-wake cycle.

Maintaining stable blood sugar levels helps ensure consistent energy throughout the
                                    day, which in turn supports a regular sleep-wake cycle. Fluctuations in blood sugar
                                    can cause energy crashes, making it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep.

A healthy gut microbiome promotes the production of sleep-regulating hormones such as
                                    serotonin and melatonin which are responsible for the sleep-wake cycle.

### So, we got some herbs.
