## WHY I FORMULATED the science behind it

![science behind formulation](//cosmix.in/cdn/shop/files/Vibha_s_pic.png?v=1718258141&width=1200)

Forget what you thought about digestion starting in your stomach! Your grandma (and in my case, my ajji) was onto something when she served you bitter gourd for lunch, again. Turns outbitters are better for digestion.Our digestion in fact begins in our mouths, where taste receptors play a crucial role in digestive health. When we consume something bitter, our taste receptors send a message throughout our digestive system to ramp up the production of its natural digestive juices. These juices help break down food efficiently, leading to smoother digestion and better nutrient absorption.

That's why My Happy Gut is formulated with naturally bitter herbs like Ashoka bark, Triphala, Ginger, Jeera, and Mulethi. These ingredients not only soothe indigestion but also act as prebiotics, nourishing the good bacteria in your gut. I’m not here to sugarcoat things (literally or figuratively) – because a truly happy gut deserves the real deal.

So, when you taste My Happy Gut, remember – that slightly bitter taste is your body's way of saying "thank you" for giving it the tools it needs to function at its best.

[Affect Your Mood With Your Food

Have you ever felt that your mind is racing, your mood is off and you’re annoyed for no reason? You want to control these feelings, but you can’t? 
I’ve felt that helpless feeling too. If my tooth is hurting, the dentist can fix it! If my skin has a rash, I can use an ice pack and relieve myself of the inflamed feeling. Sometimes just scratching that itch can provide relief. But when it comes to your mind, there’s a bit of a problem - it’s tough to directly access it. 
But the good news is that your gut can influence your brain, your mood and your emotions! Studies show that serotonin and dopamine release may all be affected by disturbances in the gut microbiota. (1) There's been very sound research in the last few years pointing to the gut-brain axis. And here’s the thing, while you can’t directly access your brain, you absolutely can access your gut. How, you ask? Through your food and herbs! 

Your gut affects your brain and how? 

Did you know we have a second brain? Yes, it exists and it’s the Vagus Nerve! The vagus nerve, the longest cranial nerve, plays a crucial role in bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. 
The digestive system is remarkably complex. The ENS is composed of millions of neurons in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. These neurons are arranged as intricate layers of nervous tissue that receive messages from the vagus nerve and are responsible for promoting the secretion of digestive juices, permitting food to pass from one area of the digestive system to another, and controlling peristalsis. 
While we always knew that the brain affects the gut, research has found that approximately 95% of nerve fibre in the vagus nerve carry information from the gut to the brain rather than the other way around! (2) Though not responsible for complicated thought processes (that's the brain's job), the ENS plays a key role in emotions and gut feelings. Thus, keeping the digestive system healthy is a great way to avoid imbalance of the body and the mind.

This happy hormone is produced in the gut 

One of the key players in the gut-brain connection is serotonin, a neurotransmitter often associated with mood regulation. While many associate serotonin with the brain, did you know that 95% of this “feel good hormone” supply is found in the gut? (3) When your gut is healthy, it produces and releases serotonin, which helps regulate your mood and promote feelings of happiness and well-being. Conversely, an imbalanced gut can impact serotonin levels and contribute to mood disorders such as anxiety and depression.
Basically, take care of your gut! 
Food: One of the generally agreed-upon criteria for a healthy gut microbiome and gut-brain connection has been its diversity and the abundance of microbial species present in it. (4) 
However, today having antibiotics for every small concern has become the way of life. Unfortunately, this depletes a lot of the good bacteria as well. You can always resolve this imbalance by incorporating probiotics in your diet! Probiotics are fermented foods that have a high population of beneficial bacteria. Kimchi, sauerkraut and non-spicy pickles are great examples. You can also incorporate traditional foods idli and dosa which are fermented overnight. 
While probiotics are important, what is even more essential are prebiotics, which are food for the good bacteria that help them thrive. These are commonly found in your pantry staples such as garlic, onion, banana and whole grains. 
Herbs: As a herbalist, studying these guys is what I’m obsessed with doing. Let’s deep dive into classifications of herbs that can help -
 Herbs that can help 

While probiotics, prebiotics, astringents, carminatives and demulcents can have a big impact on the gut and therefore the brain, here we’ll study the 3 classifications that can have an even larger impact on the gut-brain axis since they have a direct connection with both the nervous system and the digestive system - Bitters, Nervines and Adaptogens.
Bitters - Bitter tasting herbs have a very direct relationship with the nervous system and the gut. When bitter taste receptors on our tongue detect the bitter taste, a signal is sent via the gustatory and vagus nerves to the brain to prepare the body for digestion. Thus, the parasympathetic nervous system is activated and digestive secretions are released. In this way, bitters not only improve the digestibility of food, but also have a calming effect on the nervous system, putting us in a more emotionally relaxed state, which has an added bonus: we can slow down enough to enjoy our food! A strong and powerful bitter is Bhumi Amalaki or Gale of the Wind (Phyllanthus niruri). I’ve implemented this herb into our Love Your Liver due to the strong liver-gut connection. 
Nervines - Nervines nourish and support the nervous system. Calamus is a great herb in this category! 
Adaptogens -  Licorice or Mulethi root is known to provide protection and relief to inflamed tissue along the digestive tract. It can also increase mucus production in the stomach which soothes the stomach lining and increases blood supply to the stomach.

[Blood Sugar Management 101


Have you often heard from your parents, or grandparents or even your friend that they need to get their blood sugar in control? Growing up, I always thought only people who are at risk for diabetes need to be wary of their blood sugar. But when I started my own wellness journey I realised that it may not be the case. Blood sugar management is an essential for everyone (yes, not just for the middle aged) and it is connected to everything - weight, metabolism, acne, brain fog and more. In this article, I’ll explain the science behind blood sugar and why it is important to get it in balance.  
Let’s start with blood sugar basics 
 Chapter 1: Glucose, our primary source of energy  
We need energy to stay alive, and we get this from the food we eat - more specifically, glucose. Most of the food we eat is made up of glucose - broccoli, banana, bread, they all have it! When we eat food, our body starts to break down the carbs into glucose. The glucose travels through our bloodstream to cells where the glucose is further broken down (this process is called glycolysis) and releases energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), or simply “energy currency” of the cell. 

Chapter 2: Insulin - the key to locking away glucose 
Insulin is a hormone released by our pancreas when glucose enters our bloodstream. Insulin acts like a “key” that helps glucose enter our cells. Our cells have tiny doors, called receptors, and insulin binds to these receptors which signals the cells to open and allow glucose in.  

When there is excess glucose that our cells do not need, insulin stashes it away as glycogen in our liver and muscles to keep it out of circulation and protect us from damage. Whenever our body needs glucose, during exercise or in between meals, our body releases glycogen stores by quickly converting it back to glucose. 

When things start to become troublesome
When we consume carbs too quickly our blood sugar tends to spike. And as we learnt above, when this happens insulin, the “key”, is released to “lock” away the glucose in our cells so that it is not floating free in our bloodstream. 

But what happens when on a regular basis we consume more glucose than insulin can stash away? Insulin starts storing the excess glucose in our liver and muscles and when these stores fill up, the glucose gets converted into fat. These frequent glucose spikes overwhelm our body’s insulin response over time, making our cells resist the insulin, a.k.a insulin resistance. Due to this, our body produces even more insulin for the increased glucose that is floating around in our bloodstream. This persistent elevation of insulin levels is identified as the underlying factor contributing to conditions like obesity, type 2 diabetes, PCOS, and other health issues in the long run. (1)

Balancing, a delicate act  
We should strive to avoid increasing our glucose levels by more than 30 mg/dL after eating. 
The goal is to flatten the spikes, whatever your fasting level is, because it’s the variability caused by spikes that is most problematic. It’s years of repeated daily spikes that slowly increase our fasting glucose level, a pattern we discover only once that level is classified as pre-diabetic. By then, the damage has already started. Another way to describe flattening your glucose curves is reducing glycemic variability. The smaller the glycemic variability, the better your health will be. (2)

Some simple methods to reduce the spike 

Front-loading protein at breakfast - We've often heard of eating till you are 80% full and leave some space and while this stands true for other meals, what has helped me is eating breakfast till you're feeIing full and then a little more. Eating a big breakfast full of protein and fats, helps me power through the day and manage cravings. As protein and carbs do not break down so quickly, they help you feel full for longer and increase satiety. 


Strength training - Strength training has been an absolute game changer in my road to balancing blood sugar spikes, take it from a girl who hated lifting weights. Our muscle is the most insulin-sensitive tissue in the body, so more strength training = more muscle = more insulin-sensitivity! (3)



Herbs to regulate blood sugar -  Cinnamon is known to not only increase insulin sensitivity and help with PCOS, but also support glucose transportation and utilisation in our cell. (4) 


Having more fibre rich meals - Unlike carbs, fibre isn’t broken down into glucose by our digestive system. It creates kind of a viscous mesh in the small intestine, making it harder for glucose to make it through to the bloodstream and thus delaying the glucose spike.   


I’ll have a lot more blogs on this topic since it’s quite complex and vast. For now, I hope you enjoyed learning about the basics.

## LEARN MORE ABOUT MY HAPPY GUT 👇

![](//cosmix.in/cdn/shop/files/MHG_cleaned_3.png?v=1717396235&width=1000)

How does My Happy Gut help with gastritis, IBS and other digestive issues?

expand_more

My Happy Gut contains gut loving ingredients that work synergistically to address short term and chronic digestive issues. Mulethi can relieve inflammation in the digestive tract by increasing the mucus production which helps with indigestion, acid reflux, upset stomach and heartburn. Anti-gas properties in jeera are known to treat symptoms such as bloating, excessive flatulence and burping. Fermented papaya, guava, and triphala, all can help in balancing bacterias in our gut, which helps with symptoms of gastritis and IBS that are caused by overgrowth of harmful bacteria.

Does it help regularise bowel movement?

expand_more

Yes, My Happy Gut can regularise bowel movements especially for those experiencing irregularities such as constipation and diarrhoea. Mulethi and Guava’s high fibre content helps with digestion by both solidifying and softening stools. This can ease the symptoms of both diarrhoea and constipation. Papaya contains an enzyme, papain, that helps with digestion, especially digestion of proteins, which can also relieve constipation.

Can it help with my skin issues such as acne, dandruff etc?

expand_more

My Happy Gut may improve skin issues such as acne, dandruff, and inflamed skin conditions, since the gut and skin are very much connected as they are both elimination organs. A poor functioning gut can re-absorb toxins which show up on the skin as blemishes, acne etc. Ashoka root and mulethi contain antimicrobial and antiinflammatory properties that are known to help in treating various skin conditions such as acne, pimples, psoriasis, scabies, eczema, etc. If you’re facing skin issues along with digestive concerns, we recommend pairing My Happy Gut with Feel good Skin  or Healthy Hair.

How do I know if I need My Happy Gut or Love Your Liver?

expand_more

Symptoms can be very similar between gut issues and liver issues, as there is such a thing as gut-liver axis, which acknowledges how the gut and liver depend on each other and work together in the body. If you have symptoms like burping, gas, flatulence, bloating, constipation, or diarrhoea, you should start with My Happy Gut. If you experience chronic gut illnesses such as IBS, you should start with My Happy Gut and consider supplementing with  Love Your Liver.

What other measures I can take to support my gut to get the most out of My Happy Gut?

expand_more

There are multiple steps you can take so that your gut receives maximum support along with consuming My Happy Gut. Eat richer, more colourful and diverse foods in order to boost the good bacteria in our gut. Eat more fruit and stay hydrated to not be a victim of chronic constipation and diarrhoea. Consuming more probiotic foods strengthens your gut microbiome and thus makes your immune system stronger and aids digestion. Having an active lifestyle can also help support your gut as lack of movement can cause irregular bowel movements. And lastly, it is important to understand the cause of the gut problems in the first place in order to make sure they don’t reoccur.

What is the shelf life of this product?

expand_more

My Happy Gut has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacturing.

Can I mix 2 or 3 supplements?

expand_more

Yes, you absolutely can. Our mixes are safe to be consumed together, just make sure that you're keeping yourself well-hydrated! Please keep in mind that All Day Energy cannot be consumed with Sleep Like A Baby as they are meant to be had at different times of the day.

Can I take this with other prescription medicines?

expand_more

While this mix is safe for consumption with no known contraindications, we always recommend consulting your doctor to rule out any potential allergies. They can provide advice based on a full understanding of your health history.

Takes times

I have nearly finished my first bottle.. I do not see feel much improvement yet but I know that this is a long process, This takes time and besides other lifestyle habits, consistency is also needed. So I am doing just that. Will keep consuming it for atleast 3 months to see if it has improved My system or not. 
It is very very bitter for me ( I hold my breath while drinking it 😅) but my mother and sister consumed it easily with no problem so I guess that depends on individual.
