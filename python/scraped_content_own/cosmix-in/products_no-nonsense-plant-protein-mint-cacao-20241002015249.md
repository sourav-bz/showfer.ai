## LEARN MORE ABOUT NO-NONSENSE PLANT PROTEIN 👇

What can I expect after consuming plant protein?

expand_more

You can expect different results depending on your goal. If you work out, it will help build muscle mass and tone your body, along with faster recovery and increased stamina. Consuming it to fill nutritional gaps will improve your daily energy levels, increase satiety and curb cravings.

How can you use our No-Nonsense plant protein?

expand_more

Those who are active and use this to build muscles and tone the body can consume it as a post-workout recovery drink. A single serving of the protein - 38g - can be added to water, or your base of choice.

Those who don’t work out, but want to make the most of its benefits, can take this in the morning. It’ll help control cravings, boost metabolism, and improve overall mental and physical capabilities.

Do I have to be working out to consume the No-Nonsense plant protein?

expand_more

While you don’t have to work out to consume this protein, your results will be different than someone who does. If you consume it without working out, you may experience better blood sugar levels and satiety, leading to weight loss and a better physique. But you will not be able to build muscle and tone your body without exercising and eating well, and simply by taking this protein - or any protein!

What are ‘amino acids’ and ‘isolates’?

expand_more

Amino acids are compounds in the human body which are essentially the building blocks of protein. They are needed in the body for building proteins, hormones, and neurotransmitters, and are naturally found in herbs and protein-rich food. The No-Nonsense Plant Protein mix contains all 9 essential amino acids.

Isolates are formed by processing a certain food, wherein its protein content is extracted into a powder form without any active chemicals. It’s necessary to use isolates with sources like peas so that one can receive the benefits of the protein without the high starch content, which could cause fatigue and digestive issues.

Does protein actually help you to lose/gain weight?

expand_more

More protein in your diet can result in different outcomes, based on your diet and lifestyle. Someone who does strength training can consume it post-workout and follow a wholesome diet to build muscle mass.

However, someone who is looking to lose weight can also consume it to deal with unwanted cravings. Increasing protein intake and replacing carbohydrate/fat-heavy food can appease the hunger hormones, leading to lower calorie intake and eventual weight loss.

How is our No-Nonsense plant protein supporting digestive functions?

expand_more

No-Nonsense Plant Protein doesn’t contain lactose, gluten, or any meat-derived ingredients - which are usually what make protein hard to digest. This protein mix contains an in-house digestive herb blend, which boosts gut health, soothes intestines, detoxifies bowels, and increases the productivity of digestive enzymes to naturally boost the movement of the digestive tract.

Will I receive a scoop with my No-Nonsense Plant Protein?

expand_more

Yes, you will receive a free standard measuring scoop with your 500g, 1kg, and 2kg protein packs! To take your protein game a notch higher, check out our sustainable scoop made with special quality neem wood. Get the Super Scoop.

What is the BCAA content in No-Nonsense Plant Protein?

expand_more

Our No-Nonsense Plant Protein contains around 4gm of naturally available BCAA per serving of 38gms.

Why is our serving size 38gms?

expand_more

While our serving size of 38gms for 24gms of protein may seem higher than others, it was deliberately formulated to allow us to get you the cleanest protein with real ingredients. Lab-made flavours like 'natural identical vanilla' and 'chocolate flavouring' in other protein powders occupy lesser volume than the real vanilla bean powder and cacao used in our formula, which is why we’ve kept our serving size a little higher. No-Nonsense Plant proteinwas made keeping everyone's health needs in mind!

Can I recycle my protein packets?

expand_more

Yes, if you’ve purchased our 38g Single Serve Sachets - you can go ahead and recycle them after use! They aren’t completely biodegradable to keep your protein mix safe inside, but their LDPE material allows them to be recycled over and over again.

While our other packets aren’t recyclable yet, we’re always working towards making our company kinder to the planet!

What is the shelf life of this product?

expand_more

No-Nonsense Plant Protein - Mint Cacao has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacturing

Protein shake - mint cacao

I am buying cosmix protein shake since they launched and mint cacao is the best among them!

05/06/2024

Shubhangi Jha

USING SINCE YEARS NOW

I and my family have been using Cosmix mixes such as Happy Gut, WWW, Hair and Skin mix, Protiens. Each and every product has been effective. Truly satisfied and hope they never compromise with the quality.

02/06/2024

Vaishali Goswami

The ingredient list made me buy this and sticking to this brand now 🙂

I tried the mint cacao, ratnagiri mango and pinacolada till now.
Loved the mint cacao and mango was also good but didnt like the texture of Pinacolada at all. It feels very powdery and I tend to cough whenever I drink that.
Will definitely continue buying other flavours from Cosmix because the ingredient list is clean.
Here's hoping that the labelled protein percentage is correct (The Protein Project has sown doubts in my mind about the labelled protein percentage in protein powders 😬)

12/05/2024

Preetham Reddy

Cosmix Flavors

I have tried all the flavors and one the favorites from the lot are Japanese Matcha, coco beat, Indonesian cocoa, strawberry flavor, mango, and the pinacolada
