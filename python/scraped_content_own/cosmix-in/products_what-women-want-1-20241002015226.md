- Regularizing the menstrual cycle.
- Providing relief from PMS symptoms such as period cramps, bloating and irritability.
- Providing support through perimenopause and menopause.

What’s Inside?

expand_more

Coconut Milk Powder, Beetroot, Shatavari, Alfalfa, Maca Root, Nettle Leaf, Lemon Balm, Vanilla Bean, and Monk Fruit. That’s all!

This mix is made with no sugars and no BS. The ingredients in What Women Want are sourced carefully to ensure the highest quality and the preservation of its nutrients.

The Approach

expand_more

Stress is a major factor in causing hormonal imbalances. During times of stress, your body prioritises making cortisol (the stress hormone that keeps you alert) over sex hormones because its main concern is your immediate safety. This delay in producing sex hormones becomes more pronounced during prolonged high-stress situations, ultimately leading to hormonal imbalances (1).

But there's more to the story. Your liver plays a crucial role in breaking down various hormones including sex hormones. When you experience chronic stress, cortisol levels rise and get queued up for processing by the liver, pushing sex hormones (2) to the back of this line(3). This results in an imbalance in the levels of sex hormones.

The approach of Want Women Want to hormonal balance begins with stress management. Lemon balm calms the body, acting as a natural mood regulator, and reducing stress and anxiety(4). Shatavari's adaptogenic properties help with mood swings(5).

Once stress is controlled, we target hormones. Maca Root eases symptoms of hormonal imbalance, like hot flashes(6) and mood swings, boosts libido, and provides essential nutrients for hormone production. Moreover, Shatavari strengthens fertility and regulates estrogen(7).

While not a quick fix, this adaptogenic blend provides gradual and sustained support for the body.

🧘🏽‍♀️ Lower Your Stress Levels (link opens in new tab/window)When cortisol levels rise, they can throw off our hormonal balance by stopping the production and detoxification of sex hormones Some self-care practices such as meditation and mindfulness, yoga, light exercise and spending quality time with friends and family can help reduce daily stress.

🍽️ Making Sure You’re Getting Sufficient Protein And Good Fats (link opens in new tab/window)Protein and good fats play a crucial role in hormonal production and function. Add them to your meals and snacks. Think about munching on nuts, avocados, chickpeas, or maybe blending up a protein shake.

🏃🏾 Move Your Body (link opens in new tab/window)Whether it's a stroll, dancing, or a Pilates session, moving your body is key to keeping those hormones in check. Find what you love to do, and make it a habit. Your body will thank you.

This mix is so close to my heart. It was the first formula I ever created, back in 2016, when I was on a journey to heal from PCOS. After years of trying medication to help with my irregular periods and hormonal acne, I began to study herbs and Ancient Herbalism to learn more about root causes. As I began to experiment on myself, I slowly began to heal and my life started to change! What Women Want was born out of my own need and I’m honoured to share it with everyone who needs more support when it comes to their hormones. 
We often think that hormonal issues are common but we don’t have to live that way - our period cycles are a sign of vitality (the 5th sign of vitality) so it’s essential to take care of it. The approach I’ve used to formulate this product is steeped in 3 core root causes -  stress management herbs, detoxing herbs and hormone-regulating herbs. 
I believe What Women Want will help you in the same way it helped me and thousands of other women.

Love, Vibha

## LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT WOMEN WANT 👇

I have PCOS. Can it help me?

expand_more

Spoiler Alert: PCOS cannot be fully cured! However, it can be controlled with lifestyle changes and the balancing power of adaptogens. Herbs such as Shatavari can protect the reproductive system and increase fertility, (as infertility is a common symptom of PCOS). Shatavari contains shatavarin, sarsasapogenin, and phytoestrogen, all of which balance sex hormones, estrogen, and progesterone in the body and help regulate period cycles along with Maca root. Many women who experience PCOS are prone to diabetes, and Shatavari is known to help with this (to an extent.)  Another major symptom of PCOS is stress and poor mood. Calming herbs like Maca root and Lemon Balm help lower cortisol levels and alleviate stress. Maca root is also known to help reduce the appearance of facial hair by regulating hormones.

I have PMS. Can it help me?

expand_more

Yes, it will! The saponins (a naturally occurring plant compound) in Shatavari have an antispasmodic effect that eases menstrual spasms/ cramps. Nettle Leaf is known to replenish lost nutrients and works to nourish the body while relieving symptoms such as cramps. Additionally, the calming properties of the Lemon Balm and Alfalfa relax your nerves and work to improve your mood.

Can it regularise my menstrual cycle?

expand_more

Yes, this mix has ingredients that are known to regulate periods. Shatavari contains saponins which makes it a natural estrogen regulator and has been used to help regulate cycles. Stress is also a common cause of delayed periods. Here’s where herbs like Lemon Balm and Maca Root in WWW help the body respond and adapt to stress by strengthening the nervous system. Maca root also contains the nutrients necessary for balancing hormone production which can lead to regulated menstrual cycles

How long should I have What Women Want?

expand_more

Once you start to feel at ease with the symptoms and a regular flow, you can stop taking the herbs. Ideally, the balance will be maintained, and your body will continue experiencing the benefits of the mix. However, we suggest continued consumption of the mix for at least 6-8 months, before you decide to stop. There is so much more to the mix than just menstrual health. What Women Want helps you with stress relief, improved energy levels, bone health (especially important for women) and an overall state of health and wellness.

Who is this mix NOT for?

expand_more

If you are taking WWW to help with hormone related issues but don’t feel any changes after taking it daily for a month, this means most likely your issues are not hormone related but caused by other factors and/ or health conditions. We recommend talking to your health care professional to establish the root cause of your problem.  Also, if you are pregnant or lactating, we suggest consulting your doctor before taking this mix.

What is the shelf life of this product?

expand_more

What Women Want has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacturing

Can I mix 2 or 3 supplements?

expand_more

Yes, you absolutely can. Our mixes are safe to be consumed together, just make sure that you're keeping yourself well-hydrated! Please keep in mind that All Day Energy cannot be consumed with Sleep Like A Baby as they are meant to be had at different times of the day.

My happy gut is genuinely a good product

I've been using my happy guy for a few months, am on my 3rd bottle now. It's genuinely a good product. I prefer having it at bedtime, and when I started having it, I would wake up feeling less bloated. Now my gut and bowel movements have also gotten better.
