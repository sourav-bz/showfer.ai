Why ‚ÄòLove Your Liver‚Äô?

expand_more

Contrary to popular belief, your liver does WAY MORE than just process alcohol.

It plays a vital role in digestion, flushes toxins out of your body, enables healthy secretion of waste and manages blood sugar and inflammation.

Together, your liver and kidneys work to remove unnecessary toxins and better absorb necessary nutrients that are important for your body‚Äôs
 vital functions.

The ingredients in our Love Your Liver blend work synergistically to improve overall health by supporting optimal kidney and liver functioning, purifying blood and preventing cellular damage due to toxin accumulation.

Long story short, the more toxins in the body, the more prone you are to chronic diseases. Hence, keeping the organs that flush out these toxins healthy is vital to maintaining good health in the long run. So come, learn to Love Your Liver holistically!

Keep scrolling to keep learning.üëá

This mix is made with no sugars and no BS. The ingredients in Love Your Liver are sourced carefully to ensure the highest quality and the preservation of their nutrients.

üç∑¬†Be More Mindful of Your Alcohol Intake (link opens in new tab/window)Alcohol can put more load on the liver and it begins to have difficulty taking care of all its numerous functions. Metabolizing the alcohol becomes a priority, leaving other work piling up. The more free space you give the liver, the better it runs.

üßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è¬†Lower Your Stress Levels (link opens in new tab/window)It is crucial to take steps to lower stress for liver health. Chronic stress leads to high cortisol levels in the body, and the liver then focuses on metabolizing cortisol and on nothing else. Practicing self-care activities like meditation, mindfulness, yoga, light exercise, and spending quality time with loved ones can help.

## LEARN MORE ABOUT LOVE YOUR LIVER üëá

How do I know if I need this product?

expand_more

If you experience any symptoms of liver and/or kidney issues, or you have any conditions that affect the liver and/or kidney, you can consider this product after consulting with your healthcare professional.¬† While some health issues don‚Äôt seem directly related to the liver and kidney,they actually can be. Symptoms of poor liver and kidney functioning can also include difficulty in digestion or waste elimination, chronic fatigue, skin problems and irregular appetite.¬† It is important for you to identify the needs of your body and act on them accordingly.

What do "toxins" in one's body really mean?

expand_more

In Ayurveda, the word ‚Äútoxins‚Äù refers to anything that our body is unable to digest or get rid of whether it‚Äôs from a natural source, biological waste from cells, or waste from foods our bodies do not digest properly. Toxins are substances created by plants and animals that are poisonous (toxic) to humans. They may also include some synthetic medicines that are difficult for our bodies to filter and digest because they are foreign to our bodies.

How does a healthy liver help with better skin and hair?

expand_more

According to medical studies, the ingredients in this mix are known to prevent fatty liver disease along with alcohol-related liver diseases (as long as the individual is no longer consuming alcohol).¬† Burdock has been known to decrease the number of lipids deposited into the liver by alcohol consumption or a high-fat diet. Compounds called lignans in Schisandra may promote regeneration of liver tissue that has been damaged by harmful influences, such as hepatitis viruses or alcohol. Remember, prevention is better than cure. It is always advisable to consult a health care expert in case of illness and/ or disease.

Will this mix help those with kidney/ liver problems?

expand_more

In case of kidney and liver problems, it is always advisable to consult a healthcare expert first and foremost.¬† That being said, prevention is better than cure. The ingredients in this mix are known to help with certain liver and kidney diseases (only to an extent, and with the right diet and lifestyle) such as alcohol-related liver disease, kidney stones and fatty liver.

What is the shelf life of this product?

expand_more

Love your liver has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacturing.

Can I mix 2 or 3 supplements?

expand_more

Yes, you absolutely can. Our mixes are safe to be consumed together, just make sure that you're keeping yourself well-hydrated! Please keep in mind that All Day Energy cannot be consumed with Sleep Like A Baby as they are meant to be had at different times of the day.
