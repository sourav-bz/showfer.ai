- Falling asleep quicker by winding down the body to state of calm.
- Improving quality of sleep by supporting restful sleep.
- Reducing morning grogginess due to poor sleep.

What‚Äôs Inside?

expand_more

Cinnamon, Schisandra, Organic Turmeric, Jatamanshi, Fennel, Coconut Milk Powder Blend, Nutmeg, Cardamom, Chamomile, Beetroot, Black Pepper, Monk Fruit. That's All!

This mix is made with no sugars and no BS. The ingredients in Sleep Like A Baby are sourced carefully to ensure the highest quality and the preservation of its nutrients.

The Approach

expand_more

Sleep Like A Baby tackles common sleep issues with a 3 pronged approach - first comes stress reduction, second and very important - blood sugar balance and finally improving gut health. Before we dive deeper into these we need to first understand how sleep actually works.

Mechanism of Sleep: Sleep is a dynamic mechanism that is our body‚Äôs way of restoring itself after all the stress, physical and psychological, it goes through during the day. Our body enters sleep mode when it senses a decrease in natural light and releases melatonin, the sleep hormone. Melatonin then produces a wave of calm in our body ultimately turning off the ‚Äòwake‚Äô switch in our brain so that our bodies enter a state of sleep.[1]

Stress Reduction: Stress, one of the most common causes, makes our body not prioritise deep sleep.[2] Moreover, low quality sleep affects how we perceive stress, i.e. we tend to handle stress worse, causing a cascading effect. SLAB contains adaptogens such as Schisandra berry to help adapt our bodies to stress better. Both these herbs are known to help nurture the adrenal glands and turn down overproduction of ‚Äòstress hormones‚Äô like cortisol.[3]

Blood sugar management[4] and gut balance[5]
 are also vital for sleep as when imbalanced can lead to common sleep issues. SLAB contains cinnamon and chamomile which have been known to help manage blood sugar[6] by slowing the release of sugar into the bloodstream. Cinnamon and chamomile[7] also  support digestion & metabolism, potentially easing the impact of heavy meals on the body. Furthermore, SLAB contains fennel and beetroot, which are rich in dietary fiber and can support healthy digestion.

Note: *Bio-individuality is a very real concept that we believe in, here at Cosmix. Since no two bodies are made the same, they will react differently to the same product.

‚è∞¬† Embrace ConsistencyTry to wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, even on weekends. Your body loves routines!

‚òÄÔ∏è¬† Sun ExposureGet sun first thing in the morning to align your body‚Äôs internal clock and regulate melatonin production. This also means no screens or bright lights before bed as this can confuse your body‚Äôs circadian rhythm.

üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è¬†A Wind Down Routine¬†Develop a wind down routine that prepares the body and mind for sleep. It can include stretching, meditation, yoga, reading a book, journaling, listening to relaxing music, deep breathing, taking a bath, etc.

While we're told to be wary of sleeping pills, often times newer trendier supplements such as melatonin gummies also fall under the same category. While these are great for short term or immediate need, sleep problems are often caused due to an underlying issue and it is vital that we address these issues. In my personal practice with clients who had sleep troubles, I worked on a blend that targets 3 root causes - stress, blood sugar balance and gut health. I had so much success with this blend and that‚Äôs when I decided to bring it to Cosmix for everyone!
If you‚Äôre going through a time where your sleep cycle is completely off, remember that sleep takes time to correct itself and become a habit. A good time to allow sleep cycle correction is 1 month. So along with following some simple sleep hygiene steps, remember that consistency makes a huge difference while using this product. I‚Äôd say good day while signing off, but good night seems better!

## LEARN MORE ABOUT SLEEP LIKE A BABY üëá

Does it contain melatonin? How is it different?

expand_more

No, it does not. Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone in our brains that regulates your body‚Äôs natural sleep-wake cycle and is produced in response to darkness. Sleep Like a Baby works differently from melatonin supplements. Instead of introducing a synthetic lab-made version of a naturally occurring hormone in our bodies, (which often has side effects like headaches, dizziness, nausea, drowsiness and reduced alertness), our adaptogenic blend works to support the body‚Äôs sleep functions by balancing our bodies back to their natural physiological state, which can lead to increased melatonin production naturally. By helping the body‚Äôs internal clock stay in tune with nature, its physiological functions can be more aligned with a regulated sleep-wake cycle.

Can I discontinue after seeing results?

expand_more

Yes, you can discontinue after you‚Äôve achieved the desired results. However, we would recommend discontinuing only if you‚Äôve implemented a solid sleep routine and feel you no longer need the assistance of these herbs because you‚Äôve made necessary changes to improve your sleep quality. While you will not experience any side effects of discontinuing use of this product, you may experience less quality sleep, which is why it‚Äôs important to make sure you have other ways to combat sleep issues built into your lifestyle. If you experience poor sleep due to medical issues, as a symptom of medications, or anything else long-term, we suggest continuing use of sleep like a baby or taking it once in a while when needed.

Will I get addicted to ‚ÄòSleep Like A Baby‚Äô?

expand_more

Absolutely not! Sleep Like A Baby works to help you move forward toward a holistic sleep routine that works to care for your overall wellness. Your body cannot be dependent on the herbs as they aim to boost the natural production of melatonin in your body while also calming down the stressors of poor sleep. Once you feel you have moved towards a desired sleep cycle that lets you experience calm, restful sleep, you may discontinue the herbs and keep on practising the lifestyle changes you made. However, if you experience poor sleep due to medical issues, as a symptom of medications, or anything else long-term, we would suggest continuing the use of Sleep Like a Baby or taking it once in a while when needed.

Should I have ‚ÄòSleep Like A Baby‚Äô or ‚ÄòBring Me Bliss‚Äô?

expand_more

It depends upon the root cause of your sleep concerns. While both Bring Me Bliss and Sleep Like a Baby both relieve stress in the body, they cannot be taken interchangeably. Bring Me Bliss helps the body cope with stress which can help with better sleep quality, however, it will not necessarily help everyone who experiences sleep issues because not everyone experiences sleep issues only due to stress. Moreover, Bring Me Bliss can be taken any time of the day, as some may want to take it in the morning or afternoon to better cope with daily stressors at work or in their personal lives while sleep like a baby should not be taken during the day as it can make one drowsy because it is preparing the body for restorative sleep.

What is the shelf life of this product?

expand_more

Sleep Like A Baby has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacturing.

Can I mix 2 or 3 supplements?

expand_more

Yes, you absolutely can. Our mixes are safe to be consumed together, just make sure that you're keeping yourself well-hydrated! Please keep in mind that All Day Energy cannot be consumed with Sleep Like A Baby as they are meant to be had at different times of the day.

Deep Peaceful Sleep

I'd been experiencing interrupted sleep. The product tastes YUM and helps me have an uninterrupted restorative sleep.

Loved it!

I have had sleeping issues, stayed up till 3:00am -4:00 am on all off days!

This helps me in not sleeping but the quality of sleep has also imported! 
I wish you can give a spoon that fits in the jar for more conviniecy!

The mix is great and helpful

Take this for quality sleep!

Been using this for 2 weeks now. I noticed the effects somewhere during 7-10th day. It doesn‚Äôt help me fall asleep faster but I do know that once I fall asleep I am KNOCKED out. Usually I suffer with intense anxiety and would be woken up even by footsteps or shadows of people walking past my room but no more! This is great if you want to stay asleep for 8-9 hours but I have realised aiming for 9 hours of sleep after taking this makes you feel like you‚Äôve had restful sleep
