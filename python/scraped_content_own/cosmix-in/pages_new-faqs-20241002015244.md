### 1. What can I expect after consuming plant protein?

Depending on your goal you could expect different results from consuming plant protein. If you consistently work out, consuming No - Nonsense Plant Protein will help to build muscle mass and tone your body, along with supporting faster recovery and increased stamina for subsequent workouts. If you’re consuming No - Nonsense Plant Protein to fill nutritional gaps in your diet then it will help you to improve energy levels during the day, increase satiety and curb cravings.

### 2. Which flavour would you recommend someone who is new to protein?

If you are new to protein supplements or are shifting from whey to plant based, we recommend our assorted flavors pack. It has one sachet of each flavor and gives you the chance try all the flavors, understand which flavor you like best and then order as 500g packs!

### 3. Do I need to be working out to consume protein powder?

While you don’t have to be working out to consume this protein mix, your results from using it will definitely be different than someone who is. If you consume this protein but do not workout, you may experience better blood sugar levels and satiety, which could lead to gradual weight loss and better physique. But you will not be able to build muscle mass and tone your body, without working out and eating well, simply by taking this protein (or any protein, really!).

### 4. When should I have the protein powder?

No-Nonsense Plant Protein can be enjoyed any time of the day!  If you are active and are using the protein to build muscles and tone your body, consume this as a post workout drink.If you do not work out, consume this first thing in the morning. This will help to control cravings, increase satiety, boost metabolism and improve mental & physical capabilities throughout the day.

### 5. How can I incorporate plant protein into my daily routine?

You can simply mix it with 300-350ml of water/milk or add it your meals in fun ways like smoothies, overnight oats or pancakes! The Classic Unflavored variant can be added to your dosa/roti batters as well. We have a few recipes on our Instagram (link opens in new tab/window) under Highlights >> Recipes.

### 6. Will it help me lose/gain weight?

Adding more protein to your diet can result in different outcomes, based on one’s lifestyle and diet. Someone who does strength training, can consume this as a post-workout drink and follow a wholesome diet, to build muscle mass.But someone who is looking to lose weight, can consume the protein as a way to deal with unwanted cravings. Protein can help keep one fuller for longer, leading to gradual weight loss. Increasing protein intake and replacing carbohydrate/fat heavy food can appease the hunger hormones, leading to lower calorie intake and weight loss.

### 7. What is one serving size?

One serving size is 38g of the protein powder, i.e 1 scoops. One serving contains 24g of protein.

### 8. How many servings of protein can I have in a day?

One serving provides 24g of protein. Based on your daily protein requirements and other meals, you can consume 1-2 servings a day.

### 9. Is your protein safe for pregnant or breastfeeding moms?

Yes, our no-nonsense plant protein is safe for pregnant and lactating mothers. However, since every mother's journey is unique, we recommend consulting with your doctor before adding the protein to your routine.

### 10. Can the protein powder be given to kids?

We don't recommend a protein supplement for kids as at that young age they can easily meet their protein requirements from nourishing, wholesome meals.

### 11. Is the protein safe for someone with Diabetes?

Yes, it is suitable for someone with diabetes! Since our protein has only real ingredients, it does not contain any added sugar. The sweetener used in our blend is natural monk fruit- which has a zero GI and doesn't spike blood sugar levels. The natural sugars content is low as well. Please check the nutritional value on our pack if you have any extreme dietary restrictions.

### 12. Does No-Nonsense Plant Protein have a complete Amino Acid Profile?

Yes, while a single plant protein isolate doesn't protein a complete amino acid profile, we use a combination of pea and rice protein isolate to ensure our no nonsense plant protein provides all 9 essentail amino acids.You can find the amino acid profile under Supplement Facts on the product page.

### 13. What is the BCAA content?

Our No-Nonsense Plant Protein has a BCAA of 4.5 to 5g.

### 14. What kind of testing do you do?

Every batch of our product undergoes third party testing to ensure it meets FSSAI standards. The test reports are now available on our product page.

### 1. How should I take this mix?

We recommend starting with ¼ tsp of the mix in a glass of warm water (or milk, if you prefer) and increasing it to ½ tsp if you’re not able to notice a difference after 2 weeks. You can enjoy your mix with even cold water, coconut water or mix it into your food. However, refrain from adding it to coffee or boiling water as the herbs might lose their efficacy.

### 2. When should I take the mix?

Anytime in the day, as long as you are consistent. Ideally, we recommend taking it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach or mixing it with your breakfast, if your stomach is sensitive. We do not recommend taking All Day Energy in the evening. 
For Sleep Like A Baby - Best taken after your last meal of the day. We recommend consuming it 45 minutes before going to bed to allow the herbs to get absorbed more effectively after you’ve given your body time to digest its last meal.

### 3. How many servings can I take in a day?

We recommend consuming not more than ½ tsp of the mix in a day. You could either split this into two servings of ¼ tsp or consume one serving of ½ tsp. 
For Passion Potion, you can consume ½ tsp as one serving.

### 4. Why is it important to take this mix daily?

Consistency is at the core of holistic health. Adaptogens that are present in this mix help target the root cause to heal and are not like a bandaid solution. Hence, it is important to stay consistent in order to reap the most benefits from the mix.

### 5. Can I use this with 2 - 3 other mixes?

Yes, you absolutely can. Our mixes are safe to be consumed together, just make sure that you're keeping yourself well-hydrated! Please keep in mind that All Day Energy cannot be consumed with Sleep Like A Baby as they are meant to be had at different times of the day.

### 6. Can pregnant and nursing mothers consume this mix?

Although our products are 100% plant based with no added sugar or preservatives, we suggest you consult a doctor before incorporating a mix into your routine. Many of our customers have taken them during their pregnancy without any issues but everybody’s journey is different and unique. Hence, a doctor would be able to assess your pregnancy/postpartum condition and give you an unbiased opinion.

### 7. I have allergies, is this mix safe for me?

While all of the mixes are safe for general consumption, it is important to check for any hidden allergies that you might have. Please go through the ingredient list carefully before consumption.

### 8. What else can I do to support myself on this journey?

It is important to nurture every aspect of health when you’re on your wellness journey. Food, lifestyle and mindset have the power to transform your health. This means making sure that you’re eating nourishing foods regularly, moving your body everyday, getting good quality sleep and managing stress on a daily basis. Along with superfoods, all of these work in synergy to heal your body from within.

### 9. How long does it take to see results?

The time taken to see results varies from person to person.  Bio-individuality is a very real concept that we believe in, here at Cosmix. Since no two bodies are made the same and each of our lifestyles are different, they will react differently to the same product.You can go through the What To Expect on the product page of the supplement are interested in/have to understand better.

### 10. What kind of testing do you do?

Every batch of our product undergoes third party testing to ensure it meets FSSAI standards.

### How to take care of my mixes?

Make sure you store the jars in a cool and dry place. Keep the lids tightly closed and avoid using a wet spoon while handling a mix. Read more about it here.

### Why do some of my jars look half-full compared to others?

Some of our products might look half-full than the others. This might be because some of the ingredients used have a higher density than the others and might make it look less. But rest assured, the quantity is 60 grams as promised :)

Here is a picture of freshly packed jars to give you an idea of what quantity to expect in each jar

### Why does one of my mixes look/taste a little different in color from my previous order?

We source freshly harvested ingredients from our farm partners every season. The difference in color/taste might depend on the time and season of the harvest. This does not affect the quality and efficacy of the mixes in any way!

### Why has my mix hardened?

All our ingredients are 100% herbs and superfoods without any preservatives or stabilizers. Thus they are highly hygroscopic in nature. This means that they absorb moisture from the air which can cause them to harden.

It is thus important to take care of your Cosmix jars and store them carefully. Read more on this article!

### What is the shelf life of the products?

Our superfood mixes and protein have a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacturing.

The hot chocolate, chai latte and pre workout has a shelf life of 9 months from date of manufacturing.
