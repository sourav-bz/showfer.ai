[Affect Your Mood With Your Food


            Read more
          

Have you ever felt that your mind is racing, your mood is off and you’re annoyed for no reason? You want to control these feelings, but you can’t? 
I’ve felt that helpless feeling too. If my tooth is hurting, the dentist can fix it! If my skin has a rash, I can use an ice pack and relieve myself of the inflamed feeling. Sometimes just scratching that itch can provide relief. But when it comes to your mind, there’s a bit of a problem - it’s tough to directly access it. 
But the good news is that your gut can influence your brain, your mood and your emotions! Studies show that serotonin and dopamine release may all be affected by disturbances in the gut microbiota. (1) There's been very sound research in the last few years pointing to the gut-brain axis. And here’s the thing, while you can’t directly access your brain, you absolutely can access your gut. How, you ask? Through your food and herbs! 

Your gut affects your brain and how? 

Did you know we have a second brain? Yes, it exists and it’s the Vagus Nerve! The vagus nerve, the longest cranial nerve, plays a crucial role in bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. 
The digestive system is remarkably complex. The ENS is composed of millions of neurons in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. These neurons are arranged as intricate layers of nervous tissue that receive messages from the vagus nerve and are responsible for promoting the secretion of digestive juices, permitting food to pass from one area of the digestive system to another, and controlling peristalsis. 
While we always knew that the brain affects the gut, research has found that approximately 95% of nerve fibre in the vagus nerve carry information from the gut to the brain rather than the other way around! (2) Though not responsible for complicated thought processes (that's the brain's job), the ENS plays a key role in emotions and gut feelings. Thus, keeping the digestive system healthy is a great way to avoid imbalance of the body and the mind.

This happy hormone is produced in the gut 

One of the key players in the gut-brain connection is serotonin, a neurotransmitter often associated with mood regulation. While many associate serotonin with the brain, did you know that 95% of this “feel good hormone” supply is found in the gut? (3) When your gut is healthy, it produces and releases serotonin, which helps regulate your mood and promote feelings of happiness and well-being. Conversely, an imbalanced gut can impact serotonin levels and contribute to mood disorders such as anxiety and depression.
Basically, take care of your gut! 
Food: One of the generally agreed-upon criteria for a healthy gut microbiome and gut-brain connection has been its diversity and the abundance of microbial species present in it. (4) 
However, today having antibiotics for every small concern has become the way of life. Unfortunately, this depletes a lot of the good bacteria as well. You can always resolve this imbalance by incorporating probiotics in your diet! Probiotics are fermented foods that have a high population of beneficial bacteria. Kimchi, sauerkraut and non-spicy pickles are great examples. You can also incorporate traditional foods idli and dosa which are fermented overnight. 
While probiotics are important, what is even more essential are prebiotics, which are food for the good bacteria that help them thrive. These are commonly found in your pantry staples such as garlic, onion, banana and whole grains. 
Herbs: As a herbalist, studying these guys is what I’m obsessed with doing. Let’s deep dive into classifications of herbs that can help -
 Herbs that can help 

While probiotics, prebiotics, astringents, carminatives and demulcents can have a big impact on the gut and therefore the brain, here we’ll study the 3 classifications that can have an even larger impact on the gut-brain axis since they have a direct connection with both the nervous system and the digestive system - Bitters, Nervines and Adaptogens.
Bitters - Bitter tasting herbs have a very direct relationship with the nervous system and the gut. When bitter taste receptors on our tongue detect the bitter taste, a signal is sent via the gustatory and vagus nerves to the brain to prepare the body for digestion. Thus, the parasympathetic nervous system is activated and digestive secretions are released. In this way, bitters not only improve the digestibility of food, but also have a calming effect on the nervous system, putting us in a more emotionally relaxed state, which has an added bonus: we can slow down enough to enjoy our food! A strong and powerful bitter is Bhumi Amalaki or Gale of the Wind (Phyllanthus niruri). I’ve implemented this herb into our Love Your Liver due to the strong liver-gut connection. 
Nervines - Nervines nourish and support the nervous system. Calamus is a great herb in this category! 
Adaptogens -  Licorice or Mulethi root is known to provide protection and relief to inflamed tissue along the digestive tract. It can also increase mucus production in the stomach which soothes the stomach lining and increases blood supply to the stomach.

[The Beginner's Guide to Protein Powder


            Read more
          

The world of protein powders can be intimidating, overflowing with jargon and conflicting advice. We get it. If we were you, we would be overwhelmed too! 

But fear not, we’re bringing a simple guide to equip you with all the knowledge you need to confidently explore protein powders and unlock their potential to integrate into your healthy lifestyle. Ready? Let’s start with the basics.

Is protein only for people going to the gym?

We’re going to burst your myth and tell you that protein powder is NOT solely for gym enthusiasts. It's an essential part of a wellness journey for anyone seeking to optimise their health to their full potential. And here’s how protein shines:

1: Helps with blood sugar management: While we NEVER recommend substituting a healthy meal with protein, consuming protein before your meals can reduce appetite and hunger levels. When people try to understand how to lose weight using protein powder, this characteristic of protein is what they have in mind. Unlike carbohydrates, protein takes approximately 3-4 hours to fully digest. This means that it causes a slower rise in blood sugar levels compared to sugary foods, which helps prevent blood sugar spikes.

2: Boosts Metabolism, and helps with food management: Protein makes us feel full, reducing cravings and helping us eat less as a whole. This unique ability of protein can be very useful – it helps avoid overeating, keeps the appetite in check, and can even help manage our weight by cutting the need for persistent snacking.

3: Muscle-Building: Protein is the foundation for muscle-building. It provides the essential amino acids your body needs to repair micro tears caused by exercise - leading to bigger and leaner muscles.

But how do I even start?

Now that you know the benefits, let’s talk about choosing the right protein for you.

Protein comes in two major categories: Whey Protein, and Plant-Based Protein. Whey protein is a protein supplement that is primarily derived from milk. Plant protein is simply protein derived from plants like peas, beans, lentils, nuts and seeds. This subtype is generally preferred by people who have a lactose-sensitive stomach or those who prefer to consume protein in its cleanest and most natural form or prefer a more vegan dietary approach. 

But how much protein powder should I take daily?

You know the crazy thing about protein? Technically, there can be no standard answer for this question. Unlike a one-size-fits-all approach, protein intake should be personalized. Your individual needs depend on factors like activity level and fitness goals. But to answer this question in simple terms - The key is to avoid obsessing over every gram. Be easy and calm about your meals, and the consequent protein intake. Most Indian foods already contain great protein sources. The biggest and main advantage of protein powder is how palatable and easy it is to track your daily intake. 

Here at Cosmix, we recommend 38g of protein powder per serving for regulars, but if you’re just starting, you can start with 20g or even less. Be patient with your body as it starts getting used to protein and its effects. Results don’t come overnight, and neither does the discipline to stay consistent!

But to build consistency, we always encourage people to be creative with the recipes they pick! Supplementing your health with protein doesn’t mean that your liquids should do all the heavy lifting. As you’re starting with protein, try blending in a banana with your water to help make your drink creamier and easier to consume! While there’s always the ever-trustworthy mixing in water, you can also try adding it to smoothies, shakes, yoghurt or even bake high-protein pancakes with it! If you ever find yourself running out of fun ways to experiment with your protein, you can check out our recipes highlighted on our Instagram page.

Can I really have protein powder every day though?

For us to answer this, you need to be sure you’re using a good protein powder. Pick something with no sugar or additives, so you’re not hurting your overall health. Also, if the thought of eating protein powder every day feels a little too overwhelming at the start, don’t hesitate to switch it up with other protein sources - like tempeh, tofu, lentils, or meat-based foods. Have fun with it! Supplements are not meal replacements, they are boosters to close & strengthen the loop of your holistic health. 

Is taking protein powder safe?

Finally, we cannot finish this article without addressing one of the biggest concerns that most people have. Many people often confuse the effects of purine-rich proteins with the effect of protein powders in general. This gives rise to a very common misconception that makes them think that all protein powders cause uric acid buildup, causing a rise in kidney or gut issues. 

We spoke to Gauravi Vinay, an ASCM-certified clinical nutritionist, about safety concerns surrounding protein, and here’s what she had to say: “Protein doesn’t cause any kidney or liver issues unless they already exist. Bad protein powders can aggravate pre-existing issues if left untreated, but protein in itself cannot create such problems out of the blue.” 

To end this blog, we’d like you to remember one final thing. Protein powder is a valuable supplement, but it cannot, and shouldn't replace a balanced diet. Eat well, incorporate some movement in your life, and get a consistent good night’s sleep, to see the magic happen!

Do consult with a healthcare professional if you have any pressing questions about incorporating protein powder into your routine. Additionally, if you have any more questions about protein, or health and wellness in general, hit us up @cosmixwellness on Instagram.

[Blood Sugar Management 101


            Read more
          


Have you often heard from your parents, or grandparents or even your friend that they need to get their blood sugar in control? Growing up, I always thought only people who are at risk for diabetes need to be wary of their blood sugar. But when I started my own wellness journey I realised that it may not be the case. Blood sugar management is an essential for everyone (yes, not just for the middle aged) and it is connected to everything - weight, metabolism, acne, brain fog and more. In this article, I’ll explain the science behind blood sugar and why it is important to get it in balance.  
Let’s start with blood sugar basics 
 Chapter 1: Glucose, our primary source of energy  
We need energy to stay alive, and we get this from the food we eat - more specifically, glucose. Most of the food we eat is made up of glucose - broccoli, banana, bread, they all have it! When we eat food, our body starts to break down the carbs into glucose. The glucose travels through our bloodstream to cells where the glucose is further broken down (this process is called glycolysis) and releases energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), or simply “energy currency” of the cell. 

Chapter 2: Insulin - the key to locking away glucose 
Insulin is a hormone released by our pancreas when glucose enters our bloodstream. Insulin acts like a “key” that helps glucose enter our cells. Our cells have tiny doors, called receptors, and insulin binds to these receptors which signals the cells to open and allow glucose in.  

When there is excess glucose that our cells do not need, insulin stashes it away as glycogen in our liver and muscles to keep it out of circulation and protect us from damage. Whenever our body needs glucose, during exercise or in between meals, our body releases glycogen stores by quickly converting it back to glucose. 

When things start to become troublesome
When we consume carbs too quickly our blood sugar tends to spike. And as we learnt above, when this happens insulin, the “key”, is released to “lock” away the glucose in our cells so that it is not floating free in our bloodstream. 

But what happens when on a regular basis we consume more glucose than insulin can stash away? Insulin starts storing the excess glucose in our liver and muscles and when these stores fill up, the glucose gets converted into fat. These frequent glucose spikes overwhelm our body’s insulin response over time, making our cells resist the insulin, a.k.a insulin resistance. Due to this, our body produces even more insulin for the increased glucose that is floating around in our bloodstream. This persistent elevation of insulin levels is identified as the underlying factor contributing to conditions like obesity, type 2 diabetes, PCOS, and other health issues in the long run. (1)

Balancing, a delicate act  
We should strive to avoid increasing our glucose levels by more than 30 mg/dL after eating. 
The goal is to flatten the spikes, whatever your fasting level is, because it’s the variability caused by spikes that is most problematic. It’s years of repeated daily spikes that slowly increase our fasting glucose level, a pattern we discover only once that level is classified as pre-diabetic. By then, the damage has already started. Another way to describe flattening your glucose curves is reducing glycemic variability. The smaller the glycemic variability, the better your health will be. (2)

Some simple methods to reduce the spike 

Front-loading protein at breakfast - We've often heard of eating till you are 80% full and leave some space and while this stands true for other meals, what has helped me is eating breakfast till you're feeIing full and then a little more. Eating a big breakfast full of protein and fats, helps me power through the day and manage cravings. As protein and carbs do not break down so quickly, they help you feel full for longer and increase satiety. 


Strength training - Strength training has been an absolute game changer in my road to balancing blood sugar spikes, take it from a girl who hated lifting weights. Our muscle is the most insulin-sensitive tissue in the body, so more strength training = more muscle = more insulin-sensitivity! (3)



Herbs to regulate blood sugar -  Cinnamon is known to not only increase insulin sensitivity and help with PCOS, but also support glucose transportation and utilisation in our cell. (4) 


Having more fibre rich meals - Unlike carbs, fibre isn’t broken down into glucose by our digestive system. It creates kind of a viscous mesh in the small intestine, making it harder for glucose to make it through to the bloodstream and thus delaying the glucose spike.   


I’ll have a lot more blogs on this topic since it’s quite complex and vast. For now, I hope you enjoyed learning about the basics.
