## WHY I FORMULATED the science behind it

![science behind formulation](//cosmix.in/cdn/shop/files/Vibha_s_pic.png?v=1718258141&width=1200)

Just like a plant needs nutrients in the soil to grow, our hair needs essential nutrients as well. While this is commonly understood by most, there is something else that is equally important that isessential to achieve healthy hair - blood circulation.According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), hair health is closely linked to the state of blood circulation in the body, in a way you can consider hair as an extension of blood. Proper circulation is considered to nourish the body’s tissues, in order to “feed the hair follicles” and thus lead to stronger and healthier hair from within. This is why we created a 2 step approach to hair health - to first nourish and then circulate those nutrients to the scalp so that your hair gets the nourishment it needs.

Healthy Hair contains superfoods & herbs that provide collagen support and antioxidants. But without them reaching the scalp, what’s even the point! That’s where Nettle comes in. It stimulates the production and growth of red blood cells, leading to better blood circulation in the body so that the vital nutrients can reach the scalp. Healthy Hair promotes the overall welfare of your hair - from roots to the tips.

At Cosmix, we celebrate bio-individuality which means that no two bodies are the same and, hence, will react differently to the same product. Sleep, nutrition and stress all significantly impact us when we're taking care of our health, so being consistent & being patient with yourself is the way to go!

Will my hair fall come back after I stop consuming Healthy Hair?

expand_more

This may be different for each individual. If this mix helps you with your hair loss and you’re looking to discontinue usage of this product while maintaining your hair health, we would recommend slowly decreasing the dose of Healthy Hair after experiencing visible positive changes. If you are maintaining a healthy diet, lifestyle, managing stress effectively, and still experiencing hair loss after discontinuing this product, you might be experiencing a chronic, auto-immune, or hormone-related condition, and as a result, experiencing hair loss as a symptom. Healthy Hair is a safe product for long-term use and while some only need it temporarily, it is safe to consume daily.

How can I know if my hair fall is hormonal as a woman? In that case, can I pair "What Women Want” with "Healthy Hair”?

expand_more

For any woman experiencing hormonal imbalances, Healthy Hair is best paired with What Women Want. If you experience other signs of hormonal imbalance such as irregular menstrual cycles, severe mood swings, cramps, or have pre-existing conditions related to an imbalance of hormones such as PCOS or endometriosis, your hair loss might be hormone-related. Menopause can also trigger hormonal hair loss and thinning of hair in women. By pairing What Women Want with Healthy Hair, your body comes back to a state of hormonal balance and your hair should naturally start to regain its original composure and shine.

Can Healthy Hair help with alopecia?

expand_more

Many studies have linked alopecia to high oxidative stress in the body. Oxidative stress occurs when your body has an imbalance of free radicals and is unable to naturally detox itself. Herbs and foods high in antioxidants have been found to be some of the most effective ways to combat oxidative stress. Amla, Goji Berry, Strawberries, and Pink Pitaya are all very high in vitamins and can increase antioxidants in the body and hence equip the body to detox itself and prevent oxidative stress naturally.

What is the shelf life of this product?

expand_more

Healthy Hair has a shelf life of 12 months from the date of manufacturing.

Can I mix 2 or 3 supplements?

expand_more

Yes, you absolutely can. Our mixes are safe to be consumed together, just make sure that you're keeping yourself well-hydrated! Please keep in mind that All Day Energy cannot be consumed with Sleep Like A Baby as they are meant to be had at different times of the day.

Is this tested for heavy metals & toxins?

expand_more

Yes, every batch is tested in 3rd party labs for heavy metals, mycotoxins, mold, yeast and pesticides.

Can I take this with other prescription medicines?

expand_more

While this mix is safe for consumption with no known contraindications, we always recommend consulting your doctor to rule out any potential allergies. They can provide advice based on a full understanding of your health history.

Healthy hair

I started healthy hair in May and I had an exam coming up in June. Usually because of the stress my skin starts acting up and I start getting a lot of hairfall. This time it didn’t, and then I realised that the only thing that had changed in my routine was cosmix. Excellent product!
