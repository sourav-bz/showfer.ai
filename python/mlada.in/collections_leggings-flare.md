## 2. The Unheard History of Flare Pants.

We have to go back in time to know the origin of the flare pants. The first bootcut flare pants were worn by American and British sailors and the most amazing fact is that flare pants were not started as trendy clothes for fashion, the main reason behind wearing bellbottom pants by sailors was their safety.Yes, you read it right, these fashionable bellbottom pants which you wear because of their unique style and unmatchable comfort were invented to save sailors' lives. During the 19th century, sailors mostly faced the issue of falling overboard, because the wide structure from the bottom of these pants made it easy to snag fallen sailors. Flare pant structure made it easier for sailors to remove the trousers in wet conditions and roll them up when working in muddy conditions.Practicality was the reason behind the origin of the bootcut flare pants but it was not before they found themselves at the heart of the counterculture rebellion. The counter-culture rebellion always uses fashion as a medium for their expression. Just like printed t-shirt flare pants had a very influential effect on counterculture.Flare pants become famous among young people in the USA during the 1960s because of the restyling of old military clothes as a symbol of antiwar emotion and peace. During mid 70s the flare pants fashion was adopted by the music and movie industry, and at that time youngsters got more attracted to flare fashion.

At Mlada, we use fabric known as Milano fabric which is also known as Milanese made by blending synthetic and natural fibers such as Polyester, Rayon, and Spandex. Polyester keeps pants durable and wrinkle-resistant. Rayon gives softness and breathability to the pants and Spandex gives the feature of elasticity and comfort.

Just like Milano fabric all around the world designers experimenting with very different materials like leather, suede, and metallic finishes are increasingly popular choices, adding a touch of luxury and uniqueness to flare fashion. Navigating new textures in fabric choices provides fashion enthusiasts with a broader range of options to express their styles.

### 7.3 Sustainable bell bottoms:

In response to the growing importance of sustainability, the fashion world is witnessing the rise of eco-friendly flare pants. Brands like Mlada adopt organic milano, and cotton, choosing recycled materials and ethical manufacturing practices to create flare pants that align with eco-conscious values. Wearing sustainable flare fashion allows individuals to make a fashion statement while contributing to environmental responsibility.

### 7.4 Fringed Hems:

The blend of flare pants and fringed hem creates a unique and attractive look. Depending on the specific design and detail these pants are affiliated with bohemian, free-spirited, or retro style. These pants are the first choice of individuals who are fans of eclectic and creative outfits.

### 7.5 Printed Flares:

Printed flare pants are the most evolved fashion choice among all. Prints on the flare pants add an extra element of uniqueness and personality to the outfits. The types of print can range from floral and geometric patterns to abstract designs or even bold, vibrant colors.
